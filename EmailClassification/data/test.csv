However, to underestimate the power of religion creating historical
events is also a big misunderstanding. For instance, would the
30-year-old war have ever started if there were no fractions
between the Protestants and the Vatican?

An ""Islamic Bank"" is something which operates in a different fashion to
your modern bank, as I have explained here (on another thread) before.
For example, Islamic banks don't pay fixed interests on deposits, but a
return on investments (which varies according to the market, and is not
fixed like interest is).

Islamic banks are a relatively new phenomenon in the Islamic world.
There are no Islamic banks in ""the West"", including the USA, to my
knowledge.  I doubt if the market for them exists there -- at least not
while ""Islamic banks"" are at a relatively early stage of their
development as is the case now.  BCCI is most certainly not an ""Islamic
bank"" -- did BCCI ever pay a fixed interest rate on deposits?  If the
answer to this question is ""yes"", then BCCI was not an Islamic bank, as
Islamic banks are specifically set up to _not_ pay or charge interest.

Whether some Muslims partially owned the bank or whatever is completely
irrelevant.

I would recomend to anyone out there to visit your local Christian bookstore
and become aware of the stuff they sell.	Quite
interesting.  Most of the stuff is far from intelectual.  (About the level of
Chick pamphelets...)  If it is a common fundie bookstore, it should have at
least one section about how you should hate Wiccans, Pagans, Catholics,
Mormons, rock musicians, and anyone else who is not as fanatical as them. 
(Hate for the ""Love of God(tm)""!) It is even more interesting watching the
people who frequent such places.  Very scary people.  They hear voices from
""God"" telling them whatever they want to hear.  (If they were not Christians,
most of them would be locked away.  Maybe this is why Federal money was
reduced to Mental institutions by the reagan administration...	Had to get
their religious leaders out...)

Saudi Arabia is an oppressive regime that has been recently interfering

Subject: Atheism survey
Nntp-Posting-Host: amhux3.amherst.edu
Organization: Amherst College
X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL7]
Lines: 100

I am doing research on atheism, part of which involves field research here
on the net.  The following is a survey directed towards all readers of this
group, intended to get data about the basis of atheistic belief.  I would
seriously appreciate it if each and every one of you would fill it out and
mail it back to me at mtabbott@unix.amherst.edu.  

First of all, I've tried to structure questions that can be answered in a
variety of ways, with varying amounts of detail; it's possible to give 
succinct answers to most everything, but there's enough here to keep most of 
you typing for hours, I'm sure.  As much detail as you want to give me (I mean 
it) is great, but it's also important for me to have as broad a base of 
individuals as possible, so even minimal responses are far better than nothing
-- it's a short survey if you just answer the questions without elaboration.  

Secondly, I hope some of the questions don't come off as obnoxious; I know that
phrases like ""What would convince you of the existence of God"" imply that I am
a seminary student intent on proving you all to be ignorant Godless heathens.
In fact, I'm not too sure about the existence of a higher power myself, so my
use of ""God"" is a question of locution rather than ideology -- it's easier 
than just repeating ""a deity or higher power"" every time.  

Also, I tend to use a lot of anthropological buzzwords like ""belief system""
although I know some of you might contend that you don't have ANY beliefs, but
are skeptical towards everything.  I understand; but you know what I mean.
Think of such buzzwords as abbreviations for the rather unweildy phrases 
required to get the precise idea across.  

Lastly, thanks!  Please fill out as much as you can, in as much detail as
you can, and send them to me.  My research and I thank you.  

---------------

Where would you place your beliefs, on the spectrum 
	Theism <--> Agnosticism <--> Weak Atheism <--> Strong Atheism?  
Feel free to elaborate on your specific beliefs.  


In what, if any, religious tradition were you raised?  Did you ever believe 
in the existence of a God?  (Several of the following questions presume 
that the answer to this is ""yes;"" if you've always been an atheist, or at
least never a theist, you may have to modify the question/answer somewhat.)


How serious was your/your family's involvement?  

How and when did you start to doubt the tenets you were raised to believe?  

How and when did your ""final break"" with your beliefs, if any, occur?  I 
realize that this is often more of an ongoing process than an ""event"" per se;
whatever the case, just describe it in whatever detail you wish.  


What contact with other atheists have you had; before and after (and during)
your ""conversion"" to atheism?  (Certainly your involvement with alt.atheism
counts -- how have net discussions affected your beliefs?)  

To what extent do you think other atheists have influenced you in your
beliefs?  Did you come by your beliefs through discussion, through
independent means, or by some combination of the two or other means?  


Are you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational
means (proofs of the non-existence of God, etc), or was it perhaps, at least 
in part, through other means (alienation from mainstream religion, etc)?  


To what extent do you feel you ""understand"" the universe through your beliefs?
What phenomena of the universe and of human existence (anything from physical
phenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human affairs) do you 
feel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs, and where are they lacking as 
an explanatory method?  

What would it take for you to question, or change, your beliefs?  What would
convince you of the existence of God, what would convince you of the 
plausibility of God's existence, and so forth?  How dynamic are your beliefs
-- are they constantly changing; have they stayed more or less the same for
some time?  

Are you involved in a career or education in science?  To what extent do you
think science has influenced your beliefs?  (Issac Asimov claimed that science
was the new ""secular religion,"" and that ""scientists are, in a very real sense,
the new priesthood.""  Do you see the pursuit of science as having a quasi-
religious base, or even a religious element?)  

---------------

This survey is intended to get data from a broad range of individuals, but
also to help me narrow down the field to a small group of people whose
ideas and histories could be very useful to me.  Would you be willing to have
me, on the basis of this survey, write you to find out more about you and your
beliefs?  If not, fine; your filling out the survey alone is great.  

---------------

Thanks again.  Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about what
I'm doing with this data, or if you have anything to say in addition to what
I've asked about above.

I bought a copy of The Satanic Verses when there was talk of the British
Government banning it.  There's nothing interests me in a book more than
making it illegal.

However, it's still sitting on my shelf unread.  Perhaps I'll get round to it
soon.  I've still got a pile of Lem, Bulgakov and Zamyatin to go through; I
don't find nearly enough time to read.  In fact, there are far more
interesting things to do than I can ever find time for; how anyone ever
manages to be bored is beyond me.  If I didn't have to sleep, maybe I could
manage it.

The onus of proof is on you, sunshine.  What makes you think that
theist leaders believe what they say?  Especially when they say
one thing and do another, or say one thing closely followed by its
opposite?  The practice is not restricted to theism, but it's there
for anyone to see.  It's almost an epidemic in this country.

Just for instance, if it is harder for a camel to pass thru' the eye

Excuse me - THE Holy Books?

#is the easiest way to excuse anything, and therefore highly attracting to
#fanatics. Not to mention the effect interpretation by these fanatics can

A god is neither the easiest way to excuse anything, nor the only way.

Riddle me this.  If a god(s) exist why on earth should we grovel?  Why on earth
should we give a damm at all?  What evidence do you have that if such a
creature(s) exist it deserves anything beyond mild admiration or sheer
hatred for what it/they have done in the past (whichever god(s) you care to
pick).  That is assuming any records of their actions are correct.

Religon offers a bliss bubble of self contained reality which is seperate
from the physical world.  Any belief system can leave you in such a state
and so can drugs.  God(s) are not a requirement.  Only if you remove such
useless tappestry can you build a set of morals to build a society upon.
It is that or keep on exterminating those who don't believe (or converting
them).

There's a difference between believing in the existence of an entity,
and loving that entity. God _could_ show me directly that he exists,
and I'd still have a free choice about whether to love him or not. So
why doesn't he?

Oh no, not again.

There is a difference between believing that God exists, and loving him.
(For instance, Satan certainly believes God exists, but does not love him.)
What unbelievers request in situations like this is that God provide evidence
compelling enough to believe he exists, not to compel them to love him.

			RAPTURE - OCTOBER 28, 1992

		WHAT TO DO IN CASE YOU MISS THE RAPTURE

I. STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANIC

	Your natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to
panic.  But to do so is absolutely useless now.  If you had wanted to get right
with God before the rapture, you could have, but you chose to wait.  Now your 
only chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the 
Tribulation.  ""But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be 
saved."" - Matthew 24:13

II. REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION

	The Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of
the rapture until Christ's second coming.  Also know as ""the time of Jacob's
(Israel's) trouble"" (Jere 30:7) and ""Daniel's Seventieth Week"" (Dan 9), this 
period will be unparalleled in trouble and horror.

III. GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM

	Soon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community 
(the revived Roman Empire), Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will
be tantamount to treason.  The Bible, however, will be your most valuable 
possession during the Tribulation.

IV. READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE

	Since all of your Bibles may be confiscated, even if you are careful, it
is imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can
quote them.  It is especially important to read Daniel, Luke 21, Matthew 24, 
Revelation, and Amos, for these books describe the events you can expect to
unfold before you.  

V. PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE

	Pray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray 
and pray.  Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual 
strength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the
sake of Christ.  

VI. DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED
ONES DIE AS MARTYRS

	After the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community, he
will institute a world economic system, designed so that you cannot buy, sell,
or eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name.  Money will be
useless.  ""And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and 
slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that
no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, 
or the number of his name.  Here is wisdom.  Let him who has understanding
calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number
is 666"" - Revelation 13:16-18.  
	The Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of 
humanity.  Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed
in the past, such as the Holocaust.
[or maybe the crusades? -M]
You cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist's
rule; it will be much worse than anything in history (Matt 24:21) ""...I saw
under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and
for the testimony which they held.  And a white robe was given to each of 
them: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, 
until both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would be
killed as they were, was completed."" Revelation 6:9, 11.
	His targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image
or take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ ""...And I saw the souls of 
those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of 
God, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark
on their foreheads or on the hands."" - Revelation 20:4.  He will use every
form of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ.  Nor
will he hesitate to use your loved ones against you, even your children, 
torturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take
the mark.  
	If you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image, however,
you will be consigned to the second death, which is the Lake of Fire.
[Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash...-M]
You cannot be redeemed.  It is better to endure torture for a short while and
gain eternal life then [sic] to endure eternal torment in the Ring^H^H^H^H Lake
of Fire.  ""...If anyone worships the Beast and his image, and receives his 
mark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink the wine of
the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His 
indignation.  An [sic] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the 
presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb."" -Revelation 
14:9-10 

[and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders; special hats given to
the first 5,000 at the stadium --M] 

VII. SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL

	Although you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist's government
until the end of the Tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is 
important for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who are
extremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake.
	The first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or
mountainous area, for the Antichrist's control will come last to the least
populated areas.  Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay 
attuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation.
[""As you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep
into our area by daybreak.  Expect delays on I-95 outbound, and perhaps school
closings"" --M] 
Store water and food, because you will not be able to purchase anything without
the mark.  Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste
from nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood.
[Get a good water filter. --M]
Bring different types of clothing for all seasons, as well as flashlights,
batteries, generators, and First Aid supplies.  In short, learn how to 
survive and live off the land as the pioneers did.

VIII. TRUST NO ONE
	
	There will be secret agents everywhere, spying for the Antichrist's
government.  Be on the lookout.
[Perot supporters take note --M]

IX. WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST

	It is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to,
for he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will
bring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it.  We can infer from Daniel 
11 certain characteristics of this man.  Popular during the first three and a
half years of the Tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves.  He will be 
physically appealing, highly intelligent, with Christ-like charisma and 
personality.  An international politician, military tactician and economic
expert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews, which
he will break after three and a half years.  He will have such supernatural 
power that a mortal wound to his head will be healed.  Even the very elect will
be deceived.  If you do not pray and read the Bible, you too will be deceived.
[Dominate the airwaves?  Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh...-M]
	The antichrist will have a companion, the False Prohphet [sic], who
will make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak.  
All who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed.  The final three and
a half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere.

X. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!

	The seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of
Christ.  The Antichrist will be defeated.  Be steadfast and endure, and you 
will be rewarded greatly in Heaven.  
	Start reading the Bible and praying fervently now.  The salvation of 
your sould depends upon it.  Determine that, come what may, you will not take
the mark or worship the Antichrist.  You still have a chance to be saved or
remain saved, but this time you will have to be ""faithful unto death.""

	May God find you ready in the hour of his glorious return!

I've been following this train of talk, and the question of dismissing atoms as  
being in some sense ""not real"" leaves me uneasy.

It seems to be implied that we obseve only the effects, and therefore the  
underlying thing is not necessarily real.  The tree outside my window is in  
this category... is observe the light which bounces off of it, not the tree  
itself.  The observation is indirect, but no more so than observations I have  
made of atoms.

Also, what about observations and experiments that have been routinely done  
with individual atoms.  I am thinking in particular of atom trapping  
experiments and tests of fundamental quantum mechanics such as the quantum Zeno  
effect, where an individual atom is studied for a long period of time.

Some of the attempts at quantum mechanical arguments were not very satisfying  
either.  One has to be carefull about making such arguments without a solid  
technical background in the field.  What I read seemed a little confused a  
quite a red herring.

Anyway, if the purpose of a public debate is to make the audience think, it  
worked.  After doing so, I'm willing to try to defend the following assertion  
if anyone cares:

Atoms are as real as trees, and are real in the ussual every-day sense of the  
word ""real"".

No one asks you to swallow everything, in fact Jesus warns against it.   But let
me ask you a question.  Do you beleive what you learn in history class, or for
that matter anything in school.  I mean it's just what other people have told
you and you don't want to swallow what others say. right ... ?

The life , death, and resurection of Christ is documented historical fact.  As much
as anything else you learn.  How do you choose what to believe and what not to?
I could argue that George Washington is a myth.  He never lived because I don't
have any proof except what I am told.   However all the major events of the life
of Jesus Christ were fortold hundreds of years before him.  Neat trick uh?

There is no way to get into a sceptical heart.  You can not say you have given a 
sincere effort with the attitude you seem to have.  You must TRUST, not just go 
to church and participate in it's activities.  Were you ever willing to die for what
you believed?

Here's a suggestion for the logical argument FAQ.  I don't think it's covered,
though the fallacy probably has a better name than the one I used:  How about
it, mathew?

INCONSISTENCY AND COUNTEREXAMPLE

This occurs when one party points out that some source of information takes
stand A, which is inconsistent with B.  There are two variations in which B is
either a mutually-agreed-on premise or else a stand elsewhere from the same
source.  The second party fallaciously responds by saying ""see, the source
really does say B, it's right here!""; this reply does not refute the allegation
of inconsistency because it does not show that the source _only_ says B.

Example of the first type: ""The Koran says unbelievers should be treated in
these ways.  We can both agree these are immoral.""  ""The Koran clearly says in
this other passage that unbelievers are not to be treated that way.""

Example of the second type: ""There are two Biblical creation stories.""  ""You're
wrong, since the Bible clearly describes the creation as [description].""

Once the Rushdie situation exploded into the media, the Muslim voice on
the matter of the book was effectively restricted to short video bytes
showing
the dramatic highlights of Muslim demonstrations. For every twenty or so
newspaper, magazine articles, interviews etc. supporting Rushdie, there
would
appear one Muslim voice. This person was usually selected based on how
dramatic and incoherent he was, not on his knowledge of Islam or the
situation at the time. This approx. twenty to one ratio continued
throughout the escalation of the crisis, with Rushdie in the central
spotlight as the man of the moment, the valiant defender of everyman's
right to free speech decoupled from responsibility. (As an aside, it's
interesting that while the hue and cry about freedom of speech went up,
some books (defaming certain ethnic and religious groups) continued
to be banned here. It was felt that they injured the sensibilities of these

groups and presented a false image which could promote feelings of 
hate towards these groups. For Muslims this kind of double standard 
was annoying.)

Rushdie saw this spotlight as a golden opportunity to lash out at
""organized""
Islam, and he did so with admirable verbal skill. The only kind of Islam
which Rushdie finds palatable is what he calls a ""secular"" Islam - an Islam
separated from it's Qur'an, it's Prophet, God, its legislation, and most
importantly from any intrusion into any political arena. Fine - Rushdie
made
his views known - the Muslim's made their anger at his book known. The
scale of the whole affair erupted into global proportions - it was, by this
time,
already a political situation - affecting governments as well as
individuals.
The situation was a serious one, with far-reaching political implications.
At the centre of this turmoil was Rushdie, throwing fuel on the fire -
engaged
in a personal crusade that made him oblivious to any sense of caution.

Now you may feel that the person in the centre of a worldwide storm such as

this has no responsibility, has no reason to exercise restraint of any
kind, has no
obligation to perhaps step back momentarily out of the spotlight till
matters calm down. Perhaps you even feel that he is justified in ""boldly""
defying the anger of all those who dare to take umbrage at his literary
work, no matter what insult they find within it. Perhaps you see him as
a kind of secular ""heroic Knight"",mounted on the his media steed,
 doing battle with the ""dragon"" of Islamic ""fundamentalism"".

Well Khomeini saw him as a disingeneous author who 
grew up in a Muslim atmosphere, knew well what Muslim's hold dear, 
who wrote a book which mischievously uses certain literary conventions
to slander, insult, and attack Islam and its most notable personalities -
who, when
faced with a situation that became a worldwide crisis, continued with
his mischief in the world stage of the media - who, even after people were
injured and killed because of the magnitude and emotion of the situation,
continued his mischief, instead of having the good sense to desist.
Khomeini saw the crisis as mischief making on a grand scale, mischief
making that grew in scale as the scale of the crisis enlarged. The deaths
of Muslims around the world and Rushdie's continued media mischief
even after this, was the triggering factor that seemed to
decide Khomeini on putting a stop to the mischief. The person at the
centre of all these events was Rushdie - he was the source of the
continuing mischief - all media support, government support was
just that - support. The source was Rushdie (and his publishers, who
were nothing short of ecstatic at the publicity and were very happy
to see Rushdie constantly in the media). The Islamic rulings that
deal with people who engage in this kind of grand-scale mischief
making, was applied to Rushdie.

>You're attempts at justification are not doing the
> image of Islam any good.

I have made no attempts at justification, only at explanation. ""Image"" is
the chief concern of Muslim 'apologists' for Islam and for Rushdie.
If Muslims willingly relegated themselves to becoming a sub-culture
within a larger secular culture, such that the secular principles and laws
had precedence over the laws of Islam - then I have no doubt that Islam
would then be thought to have a good ""image"" (Principally because it would
by and large reflect the secular image). A ""good image"" usually means "" be
more
like me"".

Your attempts at TOTALLY exonerating Rushdie reflect exactly the attitude
that
resulted in the polarization brought about by the crisis.

The fatwa came later - much later. If Rushdie didn't mouth off so much in
the
media, the fuss would have died down - no one would have been killed, no
fatwa would have been passed - the whole episode would have fizzled away.

I'm afraid I don't know arabic; I have only read translations. I wouldn't

What other basis do we have to judge a system? Especially when we can't get

go by the Imam of the mosque in Mecca? Or perhaps the guy in New Jersey? Or
perhaps you say I should go only by the Quran. Ok, whose translation? And
what about things like ""And wherever you find idolators, kill them""?

Good point, but it is being immoral in our opinion.  We don't let them choose,
we make the decision that their actions are wrong for them.

Yes, that's what I mean.

#so that it now means `absolute' ""evidence for [benefactor]"" rather than
#`relative' ""evidence for [benefactor]"" w.r.t. [bug].

Not really, I meant evidence that would tend to one over the other.  I
think this is just a communications problem.   What I am trying to say,
in my clumsy way, is that while I buy your theory as far as it relates
to theism making predictions (prayer, your 'Rapture' example), I don't
buy your use of Occam's razor in all cases where A=0.

In my example, one couldn't dismiss
[benefactor] or [bug] on the grounds of simplicity - one of these is necessary
to explain the dosh.  I brought up the 'one-by-one dismissal' process to
show that it would be wrong to do so.  From what you're saying in this
post, it seems you agree, and we're talking at cross-purposes.

#(3) is still in contradiction to (1).
#
#Some sums may help. With B = benefactor, b = bug, d = dosh arrives in account:
#
#  (1) implies  P(B+b | d) = 1
#
#Assuming that P(Bb | d) = 0, so it's either the benefactor *or* a bug
#which is responsible if the bucks arrive, but not both, then
#
#   P(B+b | d)   =   P(B | d) + P(b | d)
#
#so
#
#   P(B | d) + P(b | d)  =  1
#
#but (3) implies that
#
#   P(B | d)  =  0  and  P(b | d)  =  0.

No, this isn't what I meant.  P(B | d) = 0.5 and P(b | d) = 0.5, with
necessarily no new observation (we've already seen the dosh) to change
those estimates.  I was trying to say (again, in my clumsy way) that
it would be _wrong_ to assign 0 probability to either of these.  And that's
precisely what use of the Razor does in the case of gods - gods are
one class of hypothesis (there are many others) belonging to a set of
hypotheses _one_of_which_ is necessary to explain something which otherwise 
would _not_ be satisfactorily explained.  It can be thrown out or
retained on grounds of non-rational preference, not of science or statistics.   
Alternatively, one could chuck out or retain the lot, on the grounds
that the answer can't be known, or that the notional probability estimates
are effectively useless, being equal (agnosticism/weak atheism).

Then you seem to be guilty of the contradiction you accuse me of.  If

No, I got that.  I'm talking about the case when A=0.  You're clearly
correct when A!=0.   And I'm not constructing a strawman (though it's
certainly possible that I've misunderstood what you're saying).  However,
by any standards, a system that says when A=0, gods are highly unlikely,
and when A!=0 gods can be dismissed using the Razor, is a system purporting
to be an inductive proof that gods either don't exist, or are unnecessary
to explain any or all phenomena.  In my experience, systems such as this
(including those which purport to prove that gods exist) always contain
a fallacy upon close examination.  If that's not what you're saying, then
please put me straight.

I'm sure you are not.   After the ""San Francisco"" Earthquake 
a couple of years ago, there was a flurry of traffic on 
talk.religion.misc about how this was the result of the 
notorious homo- this that and t'other in the City.

The fact that the Earthquake was actually down the road in
Santa Cruz/Watsonville didn't seem to phase them any.

I once heard an arguement from a xtian friend similar to this.
""Christianity is a Higher Logic.  Athiest like u will not be able
to understand it.  Your atheist logic is very low.  Only thru faith can 
we understand the Higher Logic in God"".

So I asked him, ""So what is this Higher Logic?""

His answer, ""I don't know.""

This, & the posting above highlights one of the worst things about
xtainity.  It is abundantly clear to both atheists & xtains that
their believe is both illogical & irrational.  Their tactics, therefore:
to disregard logic & rationality altogether.  Silly excuses such as
the ones above and those such as, ""How can u trust science, science
was invented by man!"", only goes to further show the weakness of
their religion.

In my country where xtainity was and still is rapidly growing, xtains
never try to convert people by appealing to their brains or senses.
They know it would be a fruitless act, given the irrational nature
of their faith.
They would wait until a person is in distress, then they would comfort
him/her and addict them to their emotional opium.

Never in my life had I met a person who converted to xtainity coz it's
""reasonable"".  Rationality has no place in xtainity (see xtian arguement
against ""reason"" above).

No wonder that we don't see any detail for this claim. It is good to
remember that you have answered the statement that you are a theist
by another correspondent with that you are not a member of a denomination.
It is either stupidity or an attempt at a trick answer. Not unlike the
rest of your arguments.

I am extremely wary of the way you use words. Like in this case, there
are broader definitions of gods used by persons who are considered by
themselves and others theists. I have pointed to that in my post. You
use one of them.
 
Your use of definitions seems to rest on the assumption: because my
moral is objective/absolute or the other buzz words you are so fond
of, everybody will know it, and there is no need to define it more
exactly.
 
And as a user has shown recently, the easiest way to dispell you is
to ask you for definitions.

Since you are the only one seeing them, and many correspondents

can't say I am impressed.

It has. There is a guy running around in Switzerland who claims to have
been conceived similarly. His mother says the same. His father is said to
be a bit surprised.
 
But anyway, there have been a lot of Messiahs, and many have had a similar
story about their birth. Or their death. A list of Messiahs could be quite
interesting.

I would wonder why an omnipotent god pulls such stunts instead of providing
evidence for everyone to check. And the whole question is absurd.
 
Wouldn't you feel bad if you'd find out that stones are sentient, and that
you have stepped on them all your life? And wouldn't you feel bad when you'd
see the proof that Jesus was just a plot of Satan?

The argument is a fallacy. It is like ""thanks for reading this far"" on the end
of a letter. Most religions claim that they won't fizzle because they contain
some eternal truth. So does Christianity. Since there are old religions it is
no wonder to find old religions that have it that they would last.
 
Roll twelve dice. Calculate the chance for the result. Argue that there must
be something special about the result because an event with a chance of
1/(6**12) could hardly happen by chance only. Feel elevated because you have
participated in letting that special event take place.

Surely it was intended as wit.

                               Books -- Fiction

THOMAS M. DISCH

""The Santa Claus Compromise""
Short story.  The ultimate proof that Santa exists.  All characters and 
events are fictitious.  Any similarity to living or dead gods -- uh, well...

WALTER M. MILLER, JR

""A Canticle for Leibowitz""
One gem in this post atomic doomsday novel is the monks who spent their lives
copying blueprints from ""Saint Leibowitz"", filling the sheets of paper with
ink and leaving white lines and letters.

EDGAR PANGBORN

""Davy""
Post atomic doomsday novel set in clerical states.  The church, for example,
forbids that anyone ""produce, describe or use any substance containing...
atoms"". 

PHILIP K. DICK

Philip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short 
stories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.
He wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than
technology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he
remained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:

""Galactic Pot-Healer""
A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a
remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the
deity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is
unable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.

""A Maze of Death""
Noteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.

""VALIS""
The schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic
Christianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of
unknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and
dismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.

""The Divine Invasion""
God invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from
another star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be
assisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.

MARGARET ATWOOD

""The Handmaid's Tale""
A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously
assassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it
""right"" again.  The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to live
under the new Christian theocracy.  Women's right to own property is revoked,
and their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the
radio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished
retroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the ""old world"" are
hunted down and hanged.  Atwood's writing style is difficult to get used to
at first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.

VARIOUS AUTHORS

""The Bible""
This somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it
is probably worth reading, if only so that you'll know what all the fuss is
about.  It exists in many different versions, so make sure you get the one
true version.

PETER DE ROSA

Although de Rosa seems to be Christian or even Catholic this is a very

(German translation: ""Gottes erste Diener. Die dunkle Seite des Papsttums"",
Droemer-Knaur, 1989)

MICHAEL MARTIN

""Atheism: A Philosophical Justification"", Temple University Press,
 Philadelphia, USA.
A detailed and scholarly justification of atheism.  Contains an outstanding
appendix defining terminology and usage in this (necessarily) tendentious
area.  Argues both for ""negative atheism"" (i.e. the ""non-belief in the
existence of god(s)"") and also for ""positive atheism"" (""the belief in the
non-existence of god(s)"").  Includes great refutations of the most
challenging arguments for god; particular attention is paid to refuting
contempory theists such as Platinga and Swinburne.
541 pages. ISBN 0-87722-642-3 (hardcover; paperback also available)

""The Case Against Christianity"", Temple University Press
A comprehensive critique of Christianity, in which he considers
the best contemporary defences of Christianity and (ultimately)
demonstrates that they are unsupportable and/or incoherent.
273 pages. ISBN 0-87722-767-5

JAMES TURNER

""Without God, Without Creed"", The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore,
 MD, USA
Subtitled ""The Origins of Unbelief in America"".  Examines the way in which
unbelief (whether agnostic or atheistic)  became a mainstream alternative
world-view.  Focusses on the period 1770-1900, and while considering France
and Britain the emphasis is on American, and particularly New England
developments.  ""Neither a religious history of secularization or atheism,
Without God, Without Creed is, rather, the intellectual history of the fate
of a single idea, the belief that God exists."" 
316 pages. ISBN (hardcover) 0-8018-2494-X (paper) 0-8018-3407-4

GEORGE SELDES (Editor)

""The great thoughts"", Ballantine Books, New York, USA
A ""dictionary of quotations"" of a different kind, concentrating on statements
and writings which, explicitly or implicitly, present the person's philosophy
and world-view.  Includes obscure (and often suppressed) opinions from many
people.  For some popular observations, traces the way in which various
people expressed and twisted the idea over the centuries.  Quite a number of
the quotations are derived from Cardiff's ""What Great Men Think of Religion""
and Noyes' ""Views of Religion"".
490 pages. ISBN (paper) 0-345-29887-X.

RICHARD SWINBURNE

""The Existence of God (Revised Edition)"", Clarendon Paperbacks, Oxford
This book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with ""The Coherence of
Theism"" (1977) and was concluded with ""Faith and Reason"" (1981).  In this
work, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the
existence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely
upon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and
aesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were
decisively rejected in Mackie's ""The Miracle of Theism"".  In the revised
edition of ""The Existence of God"", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he
makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.

J. L. MACKIE

""The Miracle of Theism"", Oxford
This (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal
arguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical
philosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through
the moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements
of the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those
positions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,
such as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as ""replacements for
God"" such as Lelie's axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less
formalistic and better written than Martin's works, and refreshingly direct
when compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.

JAMES A. HAUGHT

""Holy Horrors: An Illustrated History of Religious Murder and Madness"",
 Prometheus Books
Looks at religious persecution from ancient times to the present day -- and
not only by Christians.
Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 89-64079. 1990.

NORM R. ALLEN, JR.

""African American Humanism: an Anthology""
See the listing for African Americans for Humanism above.

GORDON STEIN

""An Anthology of Atheism and Rationalism"", Prometheus Books
An anthology covering a wide range of subjects, including 'The Devil, Evil
and Morality' and 'The History of Freethought'.  Comprehensive bibliography.

EDMUND D. COHEN

""The Mind of The Bible-Believer"", Prometheus Books
A study of why people become Christian fundamentalists, and what effect it
has on them.

GEORGE H. SMITH

""Atheism: The Case Against God"", Prometheus Books
Describes the positions of atheism, theism and agnosticism.  Reviews many 
of the arguments used in favour of the existence of God.  Concludes with an
assessment of the impact of God on people's lives.

Much of the Haight-Ashbury crowd probably had pre-existing 
dissatisfactions with their lives -- dissatisfactions ameliorated by
mumbo-jumbo about 'new realities'. The only change I experienced after 
LSD was to gain the knowledge that I didn't enjoy how LSD twisted my
perception.

Can we get back to using the terms ""strong Atheist"" and ""weak Atheist""
rather than this ""hard Atheist"" and ""soft Atheist"".  I can imagine 
future discussions with Newbies where there is confusion because of the
multiplication of descriptions.

Hang about -- not atomic interactions in general.  Just specific ones which
are deemed unimportant.  Like gravitational interactions between ions, which
are so small they're drowned out by electrostatic effects, and so on.

Oh, probably.  They still make people memorize equations and IR spectra.

So although you don't agree with the fatwa, and apparently don't think
Rushdie should be killed for his book, yet you think he is not due
sympathy for being being under this threat.  Furthermore you base this
reaction solely on the fact that he wrote about a particular
well-known story which -- if true -- might reflect poorly on the
absolute truth of your religion.  Yet, this opinion is formed without
recourse to actually looking to see how the story is used in context,
accepting at face value the widespread propaganda on just what this
book contains and what the author's motivations are.  And then you
come forward and recommend another book which touches on (presumably
""plays with"") religious/historical material because you find its
overall presentation neutral!

In article <1qiu97INNpq6@srvr1.engin.umich.edu> ingles@engin.umich.edu (Ray Ingles) writes:
 As evidence for the Resurrection, it is often claimed that the Disciples
were tortured to death for their beliefs and still did not renounce

 Now, I skimmed Acts and such, and I found a reference to this happening
to Stephen, but no others. Where does this apparently very widely held
belief come from? Is there any evidence outside the Bible? Is there any
evidence *in* the Bible? I sure haven't found any...

Briefly, no.  There is widespread folklore, but no good documentary
evidence, or even solid rumor, concerning the deaths of the Apostles.
Further, the usual context of such arguments, as you observe, is ""No
Martyrs for a Lie"": i.e. the willingness of these people to die rather
than recant is evidence for the truth of their belief.  This adds the
quite stronger twist that the proposed martyrs must have been offered
the chance of life by recanting.  Since we don't even know how or
where they died, we certainly don't have this information.  (By the
way, even in the case of Stephen it is not at all clear that he could
have saved himself by recanting).  The willingness of true believers
to die for their belief, be it in Jesus or Jim Jones, is
well-documented, so martyrdom in and of itself says little.  [See
1Kings18:20-40 for a Biblical account of the martyrdom of 450 priests
of Baal].

Another one rescued from the bit bucket...

Over the years the furor over this book has been discussed on a.a. and
elsewhere on the net.  Generally, the discussion comes down to the
contention on the one hand that TSV contains such blood libel against
Islam as to merit, if not death, than at least banning and probably
some sort of punishment; and on the other that Rushdie, particularly
as a non-muslim in a Western country, had every right to write and
publish whatever he chose, regardless of whether some muslims find it
offensive, without fear of persecution or death.  

I am naturally inclined to the latter position, but find myself in an
interesting position, because I think this is a fine book, only
incidentally concerned with Islam, and moreover I'm damned if I can
find anything malevolently offensive in it.

Over the years, when I have made this point, various primarily muslim
posters have responded, saying that yes indeed they have read the book
and had called it such things as ""filth and lies"", ""I would rank
Rushdie's book with Hitler's Mein Kempf or worse"", and so on.
Unfortunately, these comments are usually generalities, and attempts
to follow up by requesting explanations for what specifically is so
offensive have met either with stony silence, more generalizations, or
inaccurate or out-of-context references to the book [which lead me to
believe that few of them have actually read it].  Corrections and
attempts to discuss the text in context have been ignored.

Anyway, since I seem to be the only one following this particular line
of discussion, I wonder how many of the rest of the readership have
read this book?  What are your thoughts on it?

Obviously, we have different sources. Bill Moyers (who happens to be a
theist, to tie this to alt.atheism!) in his PBS documentary ""After The
War"" is my main source. (I think I still have it on videotape.) Others
include The Nation and The Progressive.

The rest of the article is mere rationalisation. You may claim that
sanitation plants are strategic ""legitimate"" targets, but what happens to
the civilians in a city with no sewer system? What happens to the
civilians when you destroy water purification plants? And when hospitals
can't handle the resultant epidemics, because there is no more electricity?

And what exactly are your sources? We have all, I'm sure, seen Postol's
interviews in the media where he demostrates how the Pentagon lied about
the Patriot's effectiveness; what is your source for the 70%
effectiveness you claim?

In any case, I don't know if this is relevant to alt.atheism. How about
if we move it somewhere else?

Of course not. I would think that would be great _fun_, not having ever
felt the joy and peace the Christians speak of with a longing gaze.
This is not what I got when I believed - I just tried to hide my fear
of getting punished for something I never was sure of. The Bible is
hopelessly confusing for someone who wants to know for sure. God did
not answer. In the end, I found I had been following a mass delusion,
a lie. I can't believe in a being who refuses to give a slightest hint
of her existence.

> Obviously there are many Christians who have tried and do believe. So .. ?

I suggest they should honestly reconsider the reasons why they believe
and analyse their position. In fact, it is amusing to note in this
context that many fundamentalist publications tell us exactly the
opposite - one should not examine one's belief critically.

I'll tell you something I left out of my 'testimony' I posted to this
group two months ago. A day after I finally found out my faith is over,
I decided to try just one more time. The same cycle of emotional
responses fired once again, but this time the delusion lasted only
a couple of hours. I told my friend in a phone that it really works,
thank god, just to think about it again when I hung up. I had to admit
that I had lied, and fallen prey to the same illusion.

I used to believe what I read in books when I was younger, or what
other people told me, but I grew more and more skeptical the more I
read. I learned what it means to use _reason_.

As a student of chemistry, I had to perform a qualitative analysis
of a mixture of two organic compounds in the lab. I _hated_ experiments
like this - they are old-fashioned and increase the student's workload
considerably. Besides, I had to do it twice, since I failed in my first
attempt. However, I think I'll never forget the lesson: 

No matter how strongly you believe the structure of the unknown is X,
it may still be Y. It is _very_ tempting to jump into conclusions, take
a leap of faith, assure oneself, ignore the data which is inconsistent. 
But it can still be wrong. 

I found out that I was, after all, using exactly the same mechanism
to believe in god - mental self-assurance, suspension of fear, 
filtering of information. In other words, it was only me, no god
playing any part. 

> The life , death, and resurection of Christ is documented historical fact.

Oh? And I had better believe this? Dan, many UFO stories are much better
documented than the resurrection of Jesus. The resurrection is documented
quite haphazardly in the Bible - it seems the authors did not pay too
much attention to which wild rumour to leave out. Besides, the ends of
the gospels probably contain later additions and insertions; for instance,
the end of Mark (16:9-20) is missing from many early texts, says my Bible.

Jesus may have lived and died, but he was probably misunderstood.

> As much
> as anything else you learn.  How do you choose what to believe and 
> what not to?

This is easy. I believe that the world exists independent of my mind,
and that logic and reason can be used to interpret and analyse what I
observe. Nothing else need to be taken on faith, I will go by the
evidence. 

It makes no difference whether I believe George Washington existed or not.
I assume that he did, considering the vast amount of evidence presented.

A liar, how do you know what my attitude was? Try reading your Bible
again. 

I was willing to die for my faith. Those who do are usually remembered
as heroes, at least among those who believe. Dan, do you think I'm
lying when I say I believed firmly for 15 years? It seems it is 
very difficult to admit that someone who has really believed does not
do so anymore. But I can't go on lying to myself.

Blind trust is dangerous, and I was just another blind led by the blind.
But if god really wants me, she'll know what to do. I'm willing. I just
don't know whether she exists - looking at the available evidence,
it looks like she doesn't.

Bill,

I'm sorry to have been busy lately and only just be getting around to
this.

Apparently you have some fundamental confusions about atheism; I think
many of these are well addressed in the famous FAQ.  Your generalisms
are then misplaced -- atheism needn't imply materialism, or the lack
of an absolute moral system.  However, I do tend to materialism and
don't believe in absolute morality, so I'll answer your questions.

>How then can an atheist judge value? 

An atheist judges value in the same way that a theist does: according
to a personal understanding of morality.  That I don't believe in an
absolute one doesn't mean that I don't have one.  I'm just explicit,
as in the line of postings you followed up, that when I express
judgment on a moral issue I am basing my judgment on my own code
rather than claiming that it is in some absolute sense good or bad.
My moral code is not particular different from that of others around
me, be they Christians, Muslims, or atheists.  So when I say that I
object to genocide, I'm not expressing anything particularly out of
line with what my society holds.

If your were to ask why I think morality exists and has the form it
does, my answer would be mechanistic to your taste -- that a moral
code is a prerequisite for a functioning society, and that humanity
probably evolved morality as we know it as part of the evolution of
our ability to exist in large societies, thereby achieving
considerable survival advantages.  You'd probably say that God just
made the rules.  Neither of us can convince the other, but we share a
common understanding about many moral issues.  You think you get it
from your religion, I think I get it (and you get it) from early
childhood teaching.

I think you've been reading the wrong sort of comic books, but in
prying through the gobbledygook I basically agree with what you're
saying.  I do believe that my mental reactions to stimuli such as ""God
commanded the genocide of the Canaanites"" is mechanistic, but of
course I think that's true of you as well.  My reaction has little to
do with whether God exists or even with whether I think he does, but
if a god existed who commanded genocide, I could not consider him
good, which is supposedly an attribute of God.

Hmm.  Yes, I think some heavy FAQ-reading would do you some good.  I
have as much place discussing values etc. as any other person.  In
fact, I can actually accomplish something in such a discussion, by
framing the questions in terms of reason: for instance, it is clear
that in an environment where neighboring tribes periodically attempt
to wipe each other out based on imagined divine commands, then the
quality of life will be generally poor, so a system that fosters
coexistence is superior, if quality of life is an agreed goal.  An
absolutist, on the other hand, can only thump those portions of a
Bible they happen to agree with, and say ""this is good"", even if the
act in question is unequivocally bad by the standards of everyone in
the discussion.  The attempt to define someone or a group of people as
""excluded from discussion"", such that they ""cannot participate"", and
their opinions given ""no weight whatsoever"" is the lowest form or
reasoning (ad hominem/poisoning the well), and presumably the resort
of someone who can't rationally defend their own ideas of right,
wrong, and the Bible.

Just like history is written by the `winners' and not the `losers.'
From what I've seen of religions, a religion is just a cult that
was so vile and corrupt it was able to exert it's doctrine using
political and military measures.  Perhaps if Koresh withstood the
onslaught for another couple of months he would have started 
attracting more converts due to his `strength,' hence becoming a
full religion and not just a cult.

You would have us believe that what the eye perceives as images are
actaully there - as perceived? This may be interesting. I thought
that an electron microscope was used because no wavelength of ""light""
can illuminate any ""object"" of atomic scale. If this image is to have
useful resolution, wouldn't the illuminating sources wavelength have
to be several orders of magnitude less than size of thing observed?

If an atom is a ""probablity cloud"", lower resolutions would give the
appearance of solidity, but it seems fairly certain that an atom is
not an object is any conventional sense. Obviously I am not a
physicist, but the question does have ramification of a philosophic
nature. Anyway, just a stray thought, carry on ...

                            FREE-ENERGY TECHNOLOGY
                       by Robert E. McElwaine, Physicist
          
               Ninety to a hundred years ago, everybody ""knew"" that a 
          heavier-than-air machine could not possibly fly.  It would 
          violate the ""laws"" of physics.  All of the ""experts"" and 
          ""authorities"" said so. 
          
               For example, Simon Newcomb declared in 1901:  ""The 
          demonstration that no possible combination of known 
          substances, known forms of machinery and known forms of 
          force, can be united in a practical machine by which man 
          shall fly long distances through the air, seems to the writer 
          as complete as it is possible for the demonstration of any 
          physical fact to be."" 
          
               Fortunately, a few SMART people such as the Wright 
          Brothers did NOT accept such pronouncements as the final 
          word.  Now we take airplanes for granted, (except when they 
          crash). 
          
               Today, orthodox physicists and other ""scientists"" are 
          saying similar things against several kinds of 'Free Energy' 
          Technologies, using negative terms such as ""pseudo-science"" 
          and ""perpetual motion"", and citing so-called ""laws"" which 
          assert that ""energy cannot be created or destroyed"" (""1st law 
          of thermodynamics"") and ""there is always a decrease in useful 
          energy"" (""2nd law of thermodynamics"").  The physicists do not 
          know how to do certain things, so they ARROGANTLY declare 
          that those things cannot be done.  Such PRINCIPLES OF 
          IMPOTENCE are COMMON in orthodox modern ""science"" and help to 
          cover up INCONSISTENCIES and CONTRADICTIONS in orthodox 
          modern theories. 
          
               Free Energy Inventions are devices which can tap a 
          seemingly UNLIMITED supply of energy from the universe, with-
          OUT burning any kind of fuel, making them the PERFECT 
          SOLUTION to the world-wide energy crisis and its associated 
          pollution, degradation, and depletion of the environment. 
          
               Most Free Energy Devices probably do not create energy, 
          but rather tap into EXISTING natural energy sources by 
          various forms of induction.  UNLIKE solar or wind devices, 
          they need little or no energy storage capacity, because they 
          can tap as much energy as needed WHEN needed.  Solar energy 
          has the DIS-advantage that the sun is often blocked by 
          clouds, trees, buildings, or the earth itself, or is reduced 
          by haze or smog or by thick atmosphere at low altitudes and 
          high latitudes.  Likewise, wind speed is WIDELY VARIABLE and 
          often non-existent.  Neither solar nor wind power are 
          suitable to directly power cars and airplanes.  Properly 
          designed Free Energy Devices do NOT have such limitations. 
          
               For example, at least three U.S. patents (#3,811,058, 
          #3,879,622, and #4,151,431) have so far been awarded for 
          motors that run EXCLUSIVELY on permanent MAGNETS, seemingly 
          tapping into energy circulating through the earth's magnetic 
          field.  The first two require a feedback network in order to 
          be self-running.  The third one, as described in detail in 
          ""Science & Mechanics"" magazine, Spring 1980, (""Amazing 
          Magnet-Powered Motor"", by Jorma Hyypia, pages 45-48, 114-117, 
          and front cover), requires critical sizes, shapes, 
          orientations, and spacings of magnets, but NO feedback.  Such 
          a motor could drive an electric generator or reversible 
          heatpump in one's home, YEAR ROUND, FOR FREE.  [Complete

               A second type of free-energy device, such as the 'Gray 
          Motor' (U.S. Patent #3,890,548), the 'Tesla Coil', and the 
          motor of inventor Joseph Newman [see SCIENCE, 2-10-84, pages 
          571-2.], taps ELECTRO-MAGNETIC energy by INDUCTION from 
          'EARTH RESONANCE' (about 12 cycles per second plus 
          harmonics).  They typically have a 'SPARK GAP' in the circuit 
          which serves to SYNCHRONIZE the energy in the coils with the 
          energy being tapped.  It is important that the total 
          'inductance' and 'capacitance' of the Device combine to 
          'RESONATE' at the same frequency as 'EARTH RESONANCE' in 
          order to maximize the power output.  This output can also be 
          increased by centering the SPARK GAP at the 'NEUTRAL CENTER' 
          of a strong U-shaped permanent magnet.  In the case of a 
          Tesla Coil, slipping a 'TOROID CHOKE COIL' around the 
          secondary coil will enhance output power.  [""Earth Energy: 
          Fuelless Propulsion & Power Systems"", by John Bigelow, 1976, 
          Health Research, P.O. Box 70, Mokelumne Hill, CA  95245.] 
          
               During the 1930's, an Austrian civil engineer named 
          Viktor Schauberger invented and partially developed an 
          'IMPLOSION TURBINE' (German name, 'ZOKWENDLE'), after 
          analyzing erosion, and lack of erosion, in differently shaped 
          waterways, and developing sophisticated mathematical 
          equations to explain it.  As described in the book ""A 
          Breakthrough to New Free-Energy Sources"", by Dan A. Davidson, 
          1977, water is pumped by an IMPELLER pump through a 
          LOGARITHMIC-SPIRAL-shaped coil of tubing until it reaches a 
          CRITICAL VELOCITY.  The water then IMPLODES, no longer 
          touching the inside walls of the tubing, and drives the pump, 
          which then converts the pump's motor into an ELECTRIC 
          GENERATOR.  The device seems to be tapping energy from that 
          of the earth's rotation, via the 'Coriolis effect', LIKE A 
          TORNADO.  [ It can also NEUTRALIZE GRAVITY! ] 
          
               A fourth type of Free Energy Device is the 'McClintock 
          Air Motor' (U.S. Patent #2,982,261), which is a cross between 
          a diesel engine (it has three cylinders with a compression 
          ratio of 27 to 1) and a rotary engine (with solar and 
          planetary gears).  It burns NO FUEL, but becomes self-running 
          by driving its own air compressor.  This engine also 
          generates a lot of heat, which could be used to heat 
          buildings; and its very HIGH TORQUE makes it ideal for large 
          trucks, preventing their slowing down when climbing hills.  
          [David McClintock is also the REAL original Inventor of the 
          automatic transmission, differential, and 4-wheel drive.] 
          
               Crystals may someday be used to supply energy, as shown 
          in the Star Trek shows, perhaps by inserting each one between 
          metal capacitor plates and bombarding it with a beam of 
          particles from a small radioactive source like that used in a 
          common household smoke detector. 
          
               One other energy source should be mentioned here, 
          despite the fact that it does not fit the definition of Free 
          Energy.  A Bulgarian-born American Physicist named Joseph 
          Maglich has invented and partially developed an atomic FUSION 
          reactor which he calls 'Migma', which uses NON-radioactive 
          deuterium as a fuel [available in nearly UNLIMITED quantities 
          from sea water], does NOT produce radioactive waste, can be 
          converted DIRECTLY into electricity (with-OUT energy-wasting 
          steam turbines), and can be constructed small enough to power 
          a house or large enough to power a city.  And UNLIKE the 
          ""Tokamaks"" and laser fusion MONSTROSITIES that we read about, 
          Migma WORKS, already producing at least three watts of power 
          for every watt put in.  [""New Times"" (U.S. version), 6-26-78, 
          pages 32-40.] 
          
               And then there are the 'cold fusion' experiments that 
          have been in the news lately, originally conducted by 
          University of Utah researchers B. Stanley Pons and Martin 
          Fleischmann.  Some U.S. Navy researchers at the China Lake 
          Naval Weapons Center in California, under the direction of 
          chemist Melvin Miles, finally took the trouble to collect the 
          bubbles coming from such an apparatus, had them analyzed with 
          mass-spectrometry techniques, and found HELIUM 4, which 
          PROVES that atomic FUSION did indeed take place, and enough 
          of it to explain the excess heat generated. 
          
               There are GOOD INDICATIONS that the two so-called ""laws"" 
          of thermodynamics are NOT so ""absolute"".  For example, the 
          late Physicist Dewey B. Larson developed a comprehensive 
          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he 
          calls the 'Reciprocal System', (which he describes in detail 
          in several books such as ""Nothing But Motion"" (1979) and ""The 
          Universe of Motion"" (1984)), in which the physical universe 
          has TWO DISTINCT HALVES, the material half and an anti-matter 
          half, with a CONTINUOUS CYCLE of matter and energy passing 
          between them, with-OUT the ""heat death"" predicted by 
          thermodynamic ""laws"".  His Theory explains the universe MUCH 
          BETTER than modern orthodox theories, including phenomena 
          that orthodox physicists and astronomers are still scratching 
          their heads about, and is SELF-CONSISTENT in every way.  Some 
          Free Energy Devices might be tapping into that energy flow, 
          seemingly converting ""low-quality energy"" into ""high-quality 
          energy"". 
          
               Also, certain religious organizations such as 'Sant Mat' 
          and 'Eckankar' teach their Members that the physical universe 
          is only the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN major levels of 
          existence, like parallel universes, or analogous to TV 
          channels, as described in books like ""The Path of the 
          Masters"", by Dr. Julian Johnson, 1939, and ""Eckankar: The Key 
          to Secret Worlds"", by Sri Paul Twitchell, 1969.  For example, 
          the next level up from the physical universe is commonly 
          called the 'Astral Plane'.  Long-time Members of these groups 
          have learned to 'Soul Travel' into these higher worlds and 
          report on conditions there.  It seems plausible that energy 
          could flow down from these higher levels into the physical 
          universe, or be created at the boundary between them, given 
          the right configuration of matter to channel it.  This is 
          supported by many successful laboratory-controlled 
          experiments in PSYCHO-KINESIS throughout the world, such as 
          those described in the book ""Psychic Discoveries Behind the 
          Iron Curtain"". 
          
               In terms of economics, the market has FAILED.  Inventors 
          do not have enough money and other resources to fully develop 
          and mass-produce Free Energy Equipment, and the conventional 
          energy producer$ have no desire to do so because of their 
          VE$TED INTERE$T$.  The government is needed to intervene.  If 
          the government does not intervene, then the total supply of 
          energy resources from the earth will continue to decline and 
          will soon run out, prices for energy will increase, and 
          pollution and its harmful effects (including the 'GREENHOUSE 
          EFFECT', acid rain, smog, radioactive contamination, oil 
          spills, rape of the land by strip mining, etc.) will continue 
          to increase. 
          
               The government should SUBSIDIZE research and development 
          of Free Energy by Inventors and universities, subsidize 
          private production (until the producers can make it on their 
          own), and subsidize consumption by low-income consumers of 
          Free Energy Hardware. 
          
               The long-range effects of such government intervention 
          would be wide-spread and profound.  The quantity of energy 
          demanded from conventional energy producer$ (coal mining 
          companie$, oil companie$ and countries, electric utilitie$, 
          etc.) would drop to near zero, forcing their employees to 
          seek work elsewhere.  Energy resources (coal, uranium, oil, 
          and gas) would be left in the ground.  Prices for 
          conventional energy supplies would also drop to near zero, 
          while the price of Free Energy Equipment would start out high 
          but drop as supply increases (as happened with VCR's, 
          personal computers, etc.).  Costs of producing products that 
          require large quantities of energy to produce would decrease, 
          along with their prices to consumers.  Consumers would be 
          able to realize the ""opportunity costs"" of paying electric 
          utility bills or buying home heating fuel.  Tourism would 
          benefit and increase because travelers would not have to 
          spend their money for gasoline for their cars.  Government 
          tax revenue from gasoline and other fuels would have to be 
          obtained in some other way.  AND ENERGY COULD NO LONGER BE 
          USED AS A MOTIVE OR EXCUSE FOR MAKING WAR. 
          
               Many conventional energy producer$ would go out of 
          business, but society as a whole, and the earth's environment 
          and ecosystems, would benefit greatly.  It is the People, 
          that government should serve, rather than the big 
          corporation$ and bank$.

I think C.S. Lewis has argued that medieval people did not all think the
world is flat.

However, this argument goes both ways. Pretend someone telling Plato that
it is highly probable that people do not really have souls; their minds
and their consciousness are just something their brains make up, and
their brains (their body) is actually ahead of their mind even in 
voluntarly actions. I don't think Plato would have been happy with this,
and neither would Paul, although Paul's ideas were quite different.
However, if you would _read_ what we discuss in this group, and not
just preach, you would see that there currently is much evidence in
favour of these statements.

The same applies to the theory of natural selection, or other sacred
cows of Christianity on our origins and human nature. I don't believe
in spirits, devils or immortal souls any more than in gods.

You might be as well planting Satan's seeds, ever thought of this?
Besides, you haven't yet explained why we must believe so blindly,
without any guiding light at all (at least I haven't noticed it).
I don't think this is at all fair play on god's part. 

Your argument sounds like a version of Pascal's Wager. Please read the
FAQ, this fallacy is discussed there.

And I failed to get help from the HS because I had a wrong attitude?
Sorry, Dan, but I do not think this spirit exists. People who claim to have

Well, yes.  This is the real mystery of the matter, and why I am rather
dubious of a lot of the source theories.

There are a number of places where the Masoretic Text (MT) of the OT is
obscure and presumably corrupted.  These are reproduced exactly from copy to
copy.  The DSS tend to reflect the same ""errors"".  This would appear to tell
us that, at least from some point, people began to copy the texts very
exactingly and mechanically.  The problem is, we don't know what they did
before that.  But it seems as though accurate transmission begins at the
point at which the texts are perceived as texts.  They may be added to (and
in some situations, such as the end of Mark, material is lost), but for the
most part there are no substantial changes to the existing text.

You're basically trying to make a mountain out of a molehill.  Some people
like to use the game of ""telephone"" as a metaphor for the transmission of
the texts.  This clearly wrong.  The texts are transmitted accurately.

It is also well known that the comments in Josephus relating to Jesus were
inserted (badly) by later editors.  As for the four gospels being in harmony
on the issue of Jesus...  You know not of what you speak.  Here are a few
contradictions starting with the trial and continuing through the assension.

>The death of Judas after the betrayal of Jesus

Acts 1:18: ""Now this man (Judas) purchased a field with the reward of 
iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his 
bowels gushed out.""

Matt. 27:5-7: ""And he (Judas) cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, 
and departed, and went and hanged himself.  And the chief priests...bought 
with them the potter's field.""

>What was Jesus' prediction regarding Peter's denial?

Before the cock crow - Matthew 26:34

Before the cock crow twice - Mark 14:30

>How many times did the cock crow?

MAR 14:72  And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind  the 
word  that  Jesus  said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny
me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.

MAT 26:74  Then began he to curse and to swear,  saying,  I  know not the man.
And immediately the cock crew.
MAT 26:75  And Peter remembered the word  of  Jesus,  which  said unto him,
Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept
bitterly.

LUK 22:60  And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest.  And immediately,
while he yet spake, the cock crew.
LUK 22:61  And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And  Peter remembered
the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou
shalt deny me thrice.

JOH 13:38  Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? 
Verily,
 verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, still thou hast denied me
thrice.

JOH 18:27  Peter then denied  again:  and  immediately  the  cock crew.

>destruction of cities (what said was jeremiah was zechariah)

(This is interesting because Matthew quotes a prophesy that was never made! 
Not the only time he does this either...)

MAT 27:9  Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy  the prophet, 
saying,  And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was
valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;

zechariah 11:11-13
(nothing in Jeremiah remotely like)

What was the color of the robe placed on Jesus during his trial?

scarlet - Matthew 27:28

purple John 19:2

>The time of the Crucifiction

Mark says the third hour, or 9 a.m., but John says the sixth hour (noon) was
when the sentence was passed.

>Inscription on the Cross

Matthew  --  This is Jesus the king of the Jews
Mark	 --  The King of the Jews
Luke	 --  This is the king of the Jews
John	 --  Jesus of Nazareth the king of the Jews

>What did they give him to drink?

vinegar - Matthew 27:34

wine with myrrh - Mark 15:23

>Women at the Cross

Matthew said many stood far off, including Mary Magdaline, Mary the mother of
James, and the mother of Zebedee's children.  Mark and Luke speak of many far
off, and Mark includes Mary Magdeline and Mary the mother of James the less.
John says that Jesus's mother stood at the cross, along with her sister and
Mary Magdalene.

>Jesus' last words 

Matt.27:46,50: ""And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, 
saying, ""Eli, eli, lama sabachthani?"" that is to say, ""My God, my God, why
hast thou forsaken me?""  ...Jesus, when he cried again with a loud voice,
yielded u the ghost.""

Luke23:46: ""And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, ""Father, unto
 thy hands I commend my spirit:"" and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.""

John19:30: ""When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, ""It is 
finished:"" and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.""

>Events of the crucifiction

Matthew says that the veil of the temple was rent, that there was an
earthquake, and that it was dark from the sixth to the ninth hour, that graves
opened and bodies of the saints arose and went into Jeruselem, appearing to
many (beating Jesus to the resurection). Mark and Luke speak of darkness and
the veil of the temple being rent but mention no earthquake or risen saints. 
John is the only one who mentions Jesus's side being peirced.

>Burial of Jesus

Matthew says the Jews asked Pilate for a guard to prevent the body from being
stolen by the disciples, and for the tomb to be sealed. All of this was
supposedly done, but the other gospels do not mention these precautions.

>How long was Jesus in the tomb?
Depends where you look; Matthew 12:40 gives Jesus prophesying that he will
spend ""three days and three nights in the heart of the earth"", and Mark 10:34
has ""after three days (meta treis emeras) he will rise again"". As far as I can
see from a quick look, the prophecies have ""after three days"", but the
post-resurrection narratives have ""on the third day"".

>Time of the Resurection

Matthew says Sunday at dawn, Mark says the sun was rising, and John says it
was dark.

> Who was at the Empty Tomb?  Is it :

MAT 28:1  In the end of the sabbath, as it began to  dawn  toward the first
day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.

MAR 16:1  And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the  mother 
of  James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and
anoint him.

JOH 20:1  The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene  early, when  it 
was  yet  dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the
sepulchre.

>Whom did they see at the tomb?

MAT 28:2  And, behold, there was  a  great  earthquake:  for  the angel of the
Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door,
and sat upon it.
MAT 28:3  His countenance was like  lightning,  and  his  raiment white as
snow: MAT 28:4  And for fear of him the keepers did shake,  and  became as
dead men. MAT 28:5  And the angel answered and said unto  the  women,  Fear
not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.

MAR 16:5  And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a  young  man sitting  on 
the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.

LUK 24:4  And it came  to  pass,  as  they  were  much  perplexed thereabout,
behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:

JOH 20:12  And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at  the head,  and 
the  other  at  the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.

>Belief that the disciples stole Jesus's body

Matthew says the guard was paid to tell this story, but no other gospel makes
this claim.

>Appearences of the risen Jesus

Matthew says an angel at the tomb told the two Marys and that Jesus also told
them, to tell the disciples to meet him in Galilee.  The disciples then went
to a mountain previously agreed opon, and met Jesus there.  This was his only
appearance, except to the women at the tomb.  Matthew only devotes five verses
to the visit with the disciples.

Mark says that Jesus walked with two of the disciples in the country, and that
they told the rest of the disciples, who refused to believe.  Later he
appeared to the 11 disciples at mealtime.

Luke says two followers went, the same day that Jesus rose from the dead, to
Emmaus, a village eight miles from Jeruselem, and there Jesus jioned them but
was unrecognised.  While they ate a meal together that evening, they finally
recognised Jesus, whereopon he dissapeared.  Returning at once to Jeruselem,
they told the
disciples of their experience, and suddenly Jesus appeared among them,
frightening them, as they thought he was a spirit.  Jesus then ate some fish
and honey and then preached to them.

John says Jesus appeared to the disciples the evening of the day he arrose, in
Jeruselem, where they were hiding.  He breathed the Holy Ghost opon them, but
Thomas was not present and refused to believe. Eight days later Jesus joined
the disciples again at the same place and this time he convinced Thomas.	Once
more Jesus made an
appearance to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias but again was not
recognised.
 After telling them to cast their netson the other side of the boat, Jesus
becomes known to them and prepares bread and fish for them.  They all eat
together and converse.

The book of acts further adds to the confusion.  It says that Jesus showed
himself to the apostles for a period of 40 days after his resurection (thus
contradicting Matthew, Mark, Luke AND John) and spoke to them of things
pertaining to the kingdom of God: ""And when he had spoken these things, while
they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud recieved him out of their sight. 
And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, two men stood
by them in white apparel: Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye
gazing into heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken from you into heaven,
shall so comein like manneras ye have seen him go into heaven"" Acts 1:3-11

Paul outdoes every other ""authority"" by saying that Jesus was seen by 500
persons between the time of the resurection and the
assension, although he does not say where.	He also claims that he himself ""as
one born out of due time"" also saw Jesus. 1 Cor 15:6-8.

>The Ascension

Matthew says nothing about it.	Mark casually says that Jesus was recieved into
heaven after he was finished talking with the
disciples in Jeruselem.  Luke says Jesus led the desciples to Bethany and that
while he blessed them, he was parted from them and carried up into heaven. 
John says nothing about it.  Acts
contradicts all of the above.  (See previous section)

>When second coming?

MAT 24:34  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all
these things be fulfilled.

MAR 13:30  Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall  not pass, till
all these things be done.

LUK 21:32  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not  pass away, till
all be fulfilled.

1 thessalonians 4:15-18

>How many apostles were in office between the resurection and ascention 
1 Corinthians 15:5 (12)
Matthew 27:3-5 (minus one from 12)
Acts 1:9-26 (Mathias not elected until after resurrection)
MAT 28:16  Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain
where Jesus had appointed them.

> ascend to heaven
	""And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven."" (2 Kings 2:11)

	""No man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven, 	...
the Son of Man."" (John 3:13)

As you can see, there are a number of contradictions in the account of the
trial, crucifiction and resurection of Jesus.  If these are good witnesses,
you would think that they could get SOME of these important details right! 
(In fact, I cannot find very many points on where they AGREE.  You would think
that they could at least agree on some of the points they were supposedly
observing!) Because of the fact that there is so much contradiction and error,
the story of the resurection as presented cannot be taken as literal truth.
(Due to the nature of the story, I doubt if it should be taken as ANY sort of
truth.)

I would guess that you either mean that you don't have a problem
swearing aligance to a non-existant being or that you are being

It doesn't come ""quite naturally"" to nonbelievers such as myself

Mathew, I agree.  This, it seems, is the crux of your whole position,
isn't it?  That the US shouldn't have supported Hussein and sold him arms
to fight Iran?  I agree.  And I agree in ruthlessly hunting down those
who did or do.  But we *did* sell arms to Hussein, and it's a done deal.
Now he invades Kuwait.  So do we just sit back and say, ""Well, we sold
him all those arms, I suppose he just wants to use them now.  Too bad
for Kuwait.""  No, unfortunately, sitting back and ""letting things be""
is not the way to correct a former mistake.  Destroying Hussein's
military potential as we did was the right move.  But I agree with
your statement, Reagan and Bush made a grave error in judgment to
sell arms to Hussein.  So it's really not the Gulf War you abhor
so much, it was the U.S.'s and the West's shortsightedness in selling
arms to Hussein which ultimately made the war inevitable, right?

If so, then I agree.

This is a very good point. I have already made the clear claim that
Khomeini advocates views which are in contradition with the Qur'an
and have given my arguments for this. This is something that can be
checked by anyone sufficiently interested. Khomeini, being dead,
really can't respond, but another poster who supports Khomeini has
responded with what is clearly obfuscationist sophistry. This should
be quite clear to atheists as they are less susceptible to religionist
modes of obfuscationism. 

So, to answer your question, the only way you can judge is by learning 
more about Islam, that is by reading the Qur'an and understanding it's 
basic principles. Once one has done this it is relatively easy to see 
who is following the principles of Islam and who is acting in a way at 
odds with Islam. Khomeini by attributing a superhuman status to twelve 
muslim historical leaders is at variance with one of basic principles 
of Islam, which is that no human being is metaphysically different than 
any other human being and in no sense any closer to God in metaphysical 
nature.

Okay, I see smilies, so this isn't supposed to be a serious post.
On the other hand, I would suppose it does has some motivation behind
it. Apparently the idea is to poke fun at religion, but there is 
presumably some sort of reasoning behind it. As an argument, this 
statement is worthless. Presuming the Qur'an is a perfect religious 
text (whatever that might be) there is still plenty of room for 
disagreement about its implications for issues far from essentials.

I've already responded to the question of how a judgment might be made
between two people who in fact _do_ disagree about Islam, which doesn't
presume anything about the Qur'an other than its having sufficient
clarity for all important disputes about the basic principles of
Islam. This hardly constitutes a claim that no two people could have
disagreements about _all_ issues relevant to Islam.

I looked back at this, and asked some questions of various people and
got the following information which I had claimed and you pooh-poohed.
The US has not sold Iraq any arms.  Their navy is entirely made of
F-USSR vessels.  Their airforce (not including stuff captured from Kuwait
which I am not as sure about), doesn't include any US equipment.  Their
missiles are all non-US.  Their tanks are almost all soviet, with about
100 French tanks (older ones). The only US stuff in the Iraqi arsenal
is a few M113s.  Those were not sold to Iraq.  Iraq captured them from
other countries (like Kuwait).  Information is hard to prove.  You are
claiming that the US sold information?  Prove it. 

Now, how did the US build up Iraq again?  I just gave some fairly
conclusive evidence that the US didn't sell arms to Iraq.  Information
is hard to prove, almost certainly if the US did sell information, then that
fact is classified, and you can't prove it.  If you can provide some
useful evidence that the US sold arms or valuable intelligence to Iraq,
I am very interested, but not if you just make claims based on what
""everyone knows"".

I read an article about a poll done of students at the Ivy League
schools in which it was reported that a third of the students
indentified themselves as atheists.  This is a lot higher than among the
general population.  I wonder what the reasons for this discrepancy are?
Is it because they are more intelligent?  Younger?  Is this the wave of
the future?

Exactly.  Although this may be a dissapointing answer, there has to be an
interplay of the two.  Personal Ethos and Societal Morality.  A person's
self-generated/learned set of beliefs are usually expressed on a purely
mental/verbal level, and don't usually find expression in society except in an
impure (not in the sense of bad :) ) state.  Sometimes this has to be so.

Also, what if one feels oneself to be part of more than one society, in a very
real sense?  To use the obvious example, there is a political society, and a
racial society, and a gender society, and sometimes they do not always agree on
every issue...

Yes.  Perhaps with an infamous ""do what you want so long as it doesn't hurt
others?""  The problem with this is that it is merely saying what you CAN do: it
is not a morality in that it doesn't propound any specifically preferred
behaviours.

I'll add a hearty ""me two"".  However, one could just as well say just because
certain actions are moral does not make them legal: one still doesn't really
get an impression of which one is truly ""right"".

I hope there is not one- with a subject like this you just have a spiral.  What
would then be a morality of a morality of morals.  Labels don't make arguments. 
One really needs a solid measuring stick by which most actions can be
interpreted, even though this would hardly seem moral.  For example ""The best
thing for me is to ensure that I will eat and drink enough.  Hence all actions
must be weighed against this one statement.""  whatever helps this goal is
""moral"", whatever does not is ""immoral""

Of course this leads such a blank space: there are so many different ways to
fulfill a goal, one would need a ""hyper-morality"" to apply to just the methods.

Seems to me we only consider something moral or immoral if we stop to think
about it long enough  :)  On the other hand, maybe it is our first gut
reaction...  Which?  Who knows: perhaps here we have a way to discriminate
morals.  I don't instinctively thing vegetarianism is right (the same way I
instinctively feel torture is wrong), but if I thought about it long enough and
listened to the arguments, I could perhaps reason that it was wrong (is that
possible!?  :) )  See the difference?

Some people might think it takes faith to be an atheist... but faith in
what?  Does it take some kind of faith to say that the Great Invisible Pink
Unicorn does not exist?  Does it take some kind of faith to say that Santa
Claus does not exist?  If it does (and it may for some people I suppose) it
certainly isn't as big a leap of faith to say that these things (and god)
DO exist.  (I suppose it depends on your notion and definition of ""faith"".)

Besides... not believing in a god means one doesn't have to deal with all
of the extra baggage that comes with it!  This leaves a person feeling
wonderfully free, especially after beaten over the head with it for years!
I agree that religion and belief is often an important psychological healer
for many people and for that reason I think it's important.  However,
trying to force a psychological fantasy (I don't mean that in a bad way,
but that's what it really is) on someone else who isn't interested is
extremely rude.  What if I still believed in Santa Claus and said that my
belief in Santa did wonderful things for my life (making me a better
person, allowing me to live without guilt, etc...) and then tried to get
you to believe in Santa too just 'cuz he did so much for me?  You'd call
the men in white coats as soon as you could get to a phone.

I don't necessarily disagree with your assertion, but I disagree with
your reasoning.  (Faith = Bad.  Dogma = Bad.  Religion -> (Faith ^ Dogma).
Religion -> (Bad ^ Bad).  Religion -> Bad.)  Unfortunately, you never 
state why faith and dogma are dangerous.  

If you believe faith and dogma are dangerous because of what happened in
Waco, you are missing the point.  

The Branch Davidians made the mistake of confusing the message with the
messenger.  They believed Koresh was a prophet, and therefore believed
everything he said.  The problem wasn't the religion, it was the 
followers.  They didn't die because of faith and dogma, they died because
of their zealotry (or, in the case of the children, the zealotry of their
parents).

>I have expressed this notion in the past.  Some Christians debated

So Christians are totally irrational?  Irrational with respect to their
religion only?  What are you saying?  One's belief in a Christian God does
not make one totally irrational.  I think I know what you were getting at,
but I'd rather hear you expand on the subject.


>A philosopher cannot be a Christian because a philosopher can change his mind,
>whereas a Christian cannot, due to the nature of faith and dogma present

Again, this statement is too general.  A Christian is perfectly capable of
being a philosopher, and absolutely capable of changing his/her mind.  Faith in
God is a belief, and all beliefs may change.  Would you assert that atheists
would make poor philosophers because they are predisposed to not believe in a
God which, of course, may show unfair bias when studying, say, religion?

So, Christianity is a prison, eh?  Ever heard of parole?  You have read far
too much into this subject.  A Christian is one who follows the religion
based on the teachings of a man named Jesus Christ.  Nowhere does this
definition imply that one cannot change one's mind.  In prison, however,
you can't just decide to leave.  One is voluntary, the other is not.  The
two are not compatible.

I prefer to think of religion as a water pistol filled with urine. 8^)
Seriously, though, some (but certainly not all) religions do condemn
groups of people.  The common target is the ""infidel,"" a curious being
who is alternately an atheist, a non-<insert specific religious
affiliation here>, a person of a different race, or an Egyptian. 8^)

Please explain how ""just because"" thinking kills people.  (And please
state more in your answer than ""Waco."")

I'll see your conscientious peacenik and raise you a religious 
zealot with bad acne. 8^)  By the way, I wasn't aware mass suicide
was a problem.  Waco and Jonestown were isolated incidents.  
Mass suicides are far from common.

I read it when it first came out, and the controversy broke. Put my name
on the waiting list at the library (that way if the book was really
offensive, none of my money would find its way to the author or
publisher), and read it, ""cover to cover"" (to use a phrase that seems
popular here right now).

And I *liked* it. The writing style was a little hard to get used to, but
it was well worth the effort. Coming from a similar background (Rushdie
grew up in Bombay in a muslim family, and moved to England; I grew up in
New Delhi), it made a strong impression on me.  (And he used many of the
strange constructions of Indian English: the ""yaar"" at the end of a
sentence, ""Butbutbut,"" the occasional hindi phrase, etc.)

At the time I still ""sorta-kinda"" thought of myself as a muslim, and I
couldn't see what the flap was all about. It seemed clear to me that this
was allegory.  It was clear that he described some local prostitutes who
took on the names and personae of Muhammed's wives, and had not (as my
grandfather thundered) implied that Muhammed's wives were prostitutes; in
short, every angry muslim that had read even part of the book seemed to
have missed the point completely.  (And I won't mention the fact that the
most militant of them had never even seen the book. Oops, I just did!)

Perhaps in a deep sense, the book is insulting to Islam, because it
exposes the silliness of revealed religion - why does an omnipotent deity
need an agent? She can come directly to me, can't she? How do we know that
Muhammed didn't just go out into the desert and smoke something? And how
do we know that the scribes he dictated the Quran to didn't screw up, or
put in their own little verses? And why can Muhammed marry more than four
women, when no other muslim is allowed to? (Although I think the biggest
insult to Islam is that the majority of its followers would want to
suppress a book, sight unseen, on the say-so of some ""holy"" guy. Not to
mention murder the author.)

>Over the years, when I have made this point, various primarily muslim
>posters have responded, saying that yes indeed they have read the book
>and had called it such things as ""filth and lies"", ""I would rank

I had much the same response when I tried to talk about the book. A really
silly argument - after all, how many of these same people have read ""Mein
Kampf?"" It just made me wonder - what are they afraid of? Why don't they
just read the book and decide for themselves?

Maybe the reaction of the muslim community to the book, and the absence of
protest from the ""liberal"" muslims to Khomeini's fatwa outrage, was the
final push I needed into atheism!

Faith and dogma are dangerous because they cause people to act on
faith alone, which by its nature is without justification.  That
is what I mean by the word ``faith'': belief without justification, or
belief with arbitrary justification, or with emotional (irrational)
justification.

For example, when someone says that God exists, that they don't know
why they believe God exists, they can just feel it, that's faith.

Dogma is bad because it precludes positive change in belief based
on new information, or increased mental faculty.

Faith and dogma are irrational.  The faith and dogma part of any religion
are responsible for the irrationality of the individuals.  I claim that
faith and dogma are the quintessential part of any religion.  If that
makes (the much overused in this context) Buddism a philosophy rather
than a religion, I can live with that.  Science is not a religion,
because there is no faith nor dogma.

Have you noticed that philosophers tend to be atheists?  If a philosopher
is not an atheist, s/he tends to be called a theologian.

A Christian tends to consider Christianity sacred.  Christianity is
a special set of beliefs, sanctioned by God himself, and therefore,
to conceive of changing those beliefs is to question the existence
of That Being Who Makes No Mistakes.  Faith comes into play.  Dogma
comes into play.  ``The lord works in mysterious ways'' is an example
of faith being used to reconcile evidence that the beliefs are flawed.
Sure, interpretations of what ``God said'' are changed to satisfy the
needs of society, but when God says something, that's it.  It was said,
and that's that.  Since God said it, it is unflawed, even if the
interpretations are flawed.

Science, (as would be practiced by atheists) in contrast, has a
BUILT IN defence against faith and dogma.
A scientist holds sacred the idea that beliefs should change to
suit whatever is the best information available at the time, AND,
*AND*, ****AND***, a scientist understands that any current beliefs
are deficient in some way.  The goal is to keep improving
the beliefs.  The goal is to keep changing the beliefs to reflect
the best information currently available.  That's the only rational
thing to do.  That's good philosophy.

Can you see the difference?  Science views beliefs as being flawed,

It's easier for someone to kill a person when s/he doesn't require
a good rational justification of the killing.  I don't consider
``he's Jewish'', or ``he was born of Jewish parents'', or
``this document says he's Jewish'' to be good rational justification.

Clinton and the FBI would love for you to convince them of this.
It would save the US taxpayer a lot of money if you could.

That's fascinating.  I take it that you're expressing skepticism
at the idea that those ignorant savages could have influenced
the Constitution of the people who stole their continent.  You
could be right, but it sounds plausible to me.  Is there any
reason that you dismiss it out-of-hand?  Here's some more:

   Recent scholarship has shown that in the mid-1700s Indians were not
   only invited to participate in the deliberations of our ""founding
   fathers,"" but that the Great Binding Law of the Iroquois Confederacy
   arguably became the single most important model for the 1754 Albany
   Plan of Union, and later the Articles of Confederation and the
   Constitution.  That this would be absent from our school texts,
   and from history, and from media is not surprising given the devotion
   Americans feel to our founding myth: Great men gathered to express
   a new vision that has withstood the test of time.  If it were
   revealed that Indians had a role in it, imagine the blow to the
   American psyche.
   ...
      By 1754, when most of these men and others gathered to creat the
   Albany Plan of Union, the first try at confederation, they invited
   forty-two members of the Iroquois Grand Council to serve as advisors
   on confederate structures.  Benjamin Franklin freely acknowledged
   his interest in the Iroquois achievement in a famous speech at
   Albany Congress: ""It would be a strange thing...if six nations
   of ignorant savages[sic] should be capable of forming such a union
   and be able to execute it in such a manner that it has subsisted
   for ages and appears indissoluble, and yet that a like union should
   be impractical for ten or a dozen English colonies.""
      According to Grinde, Franklin convened meetings of Iroquois chiefs
   and congressional delegates in order to ""hammer out a plan that he
   acknowedged to be similar to the Iroquois Confederacy.""

Grinde is Professor Donald Grinde,Jr., of the University of California
at Riverside whose book _The Iroquois and the Founding Fathers of the
American Nation_ addresses this issue.

And it is not Hirschbeck's job to help Gant with any of these difficulties.
If Gant can't gather his concentration for whatever reason, that just makes
him all the more meat in the batter's box.  The umpire's job is to 
maintain flow of play.  Gant is not entitled to time to regather his
faculties.

Nor is anyone else.

>Now, it's pretty stupid to go ahead and talk the walk when the umpire is
>telling you to get in there.  You know the umpire is going to do something
>(call for a strike, throw you out, etc.).  Gant was wrong.

Absolutely.  I think it'd be more accurate to say Gant was foolish.

>But Hirschbeck was more wrong, in my biased view.  Aside from the major chip
>he seemed to have on his shoulder, what was the problem.  Gant had a reason
>to want some time (disputed strike call).  

If a disputed strike call is ample reason for a timeout, games would last
about nine-fifteen weeks, if Jack Morris or Dave ""Whiner"" Stieb were
pitching.  A disputed strike call is not sufficient for a time out.
Suck it up, get back in the box, and never badmouth the blue.  They're
not going to change their mind, and you're just going to come across
as a pinhead, which won't help you with the borderline calls.

FTR - I never speak to umpires when I don't know them personally, nor
do I glance at them, or react to calls.  As a result, I think I get more
than my fair share of borderline calls at the plate, because I have a
rep of having a good eye.  (Actually, there are a lot of negative
connotations that go with that rep, including copious questions about
my masculinity, party affiliation, and sexual preference.)

>Gant hadn't been wasting time all
>game.  The game had been cruising along, and was just over two hours old.

Irrelevant.  He was wasting time THEN.

>The score was 1-0, with 2 outs in the ninth and a runner in scoring position.
>Is there *any* reason Hirschbeck couldn't, and shouldn't, cut Gant a little
>slack?  

1.  Because it's not his job.

2.  Because setting the precedent of cutting slack THERE can easily 
    extend to those 3 hour games.  (Kind of like the phantom DP.)

>For no discernible constructive reason, Hirschbeck disrupted the
>game, caused a five minute delay, and materially hurt the batter in a key
>situation.  Did he have a date to get to?

Gant hurt himself, and the Braves disrupted the game.  Your biases are
exposed, and I'm sitting here defending umpires and the SF Giants,
which is like Phyllis Schlafly defending Gary Segura, Jack Kevorkian,
and the Swedish Abortion Team.  

>And I still wonder why Terry was tossed earlier in the game.

I believe Terry said the magic word.  There are some truly quick ways
to get tossed from a ballgame.  For a primer, email me.

Good ways to get tossed from a game:

1.  Ask Ken Kaiser if he got his money back from Nutri-System.
2.  Kiss Rich Garcia on the lips, and say ""Hi, Honey, I'm Home!""
3.  Goose Eric Gregg.
4.  Ask Bruce Froemming if his parents had any children that lived.
5.  Get Naked.

There's nothing wrong with a red neck.  Why, some of us hicks even

that, you shouldn't try to shit on this guy by insulting where YOU

The events I saw were:
1)  Called strike by Hirschbeck
2)  Shocked-looking Gant asks for appeal to first
3)  No appeal to first
4)  Gant steps out of batters box.
5)  Hirschbeck *immediately* orders Gant back in.  [bad move]
6)  Gant ignores Hirschbeck and walks off. [bad move]
7)  Hirschbeck yells at Gant.  Gant is silent.
8)  Hirschbeck calls for the pitch.
9)  Pitch is called a strike.
10)  Cox argues (couldn't see when he came on the field)
11)  Cox is ejected, players everywhere
12)  Play finally resumes.

Gant shouldn't have ignored Hirschbeck.  Not returning made the strike
call fairly likely.  Although I suspect an argument might have gotten
Gant tossed altogether.  But if Hirschbeck had let Gant step out, the
whole incident probably would have been avoided.

Actually, according to the DA information posted by Sherri, Boggs is superior
defensively to have.  Here's their Defensive Averages for the last five
years: [compared to average at 3b, AL]

            1988        1989        1990        1991        1992
Boggs     .643[+2]    .659[+47]   .550[-54]   .653[+33]   .634[+32]
Hayes     -------     .601[-40]   .622[+18]   .606[-14]   .574[-28]

If Hayes is a defensive standout at third, he's done a good job in disguising
it.  To put it another way, compared to an average third baseman last year:

Boggs converted 11 more grounders into outs, turned 2 more double plays, and
prevented 11 doubles.

Hayes let 12 more grounders go by for hits, turned 6 more double plays, and
prevented 4 doubles.

At the time I didn't really want the Sox to sign either.  I was more
than a little worried about Viola's elbow.

But you *surely* remember my shout of relief when, after a week of
rumors that Morris was coming to the Red Sox, they ended up with Viola
instead.

Now I'm even happier.  Viola seems to have rebounded nicely.

How long did Viola sign for.  Three years?  I generally agree with
their policy of avoiding long-term contracts for pitchers.  But I
think they enforce it rather too strictly.  These days the premier
pitchers all sign three or four year deals.  Which leaves the Jays
with Morris and Stewart.  If the Jays want to compete for top free
agent pitchers, they will have to accept greater risks.

Any idea what the option year deal is for Morris?  Are there any
automatic activation clauses?  What is the buyout amount?f

Mail me your answers please; or post them.


1.  Which pitcher played for the Harlem Globetrotters?

2.  Which major leaguer briefly tried professional golf in 1978?

3.  Which does Dieon Sanders have more of (professionally):
    career touchdowns or triples?

never hit 20+ homers. I think you went 2 for 4 on this one.

His .300 season last year was good, but I'm not convinced that he can do
it again. It reminds me (sorry) of the year 1987(?) when Tim Wallach hit
30 or so homers and had 127 RBI. It never even came close to happening 
again. Of course, maybe I just prefer guys who go about their business

Not to mention that Lankford had been hurt two nights before running

I couldn't agree more.  The Jays have a lot of power in their line-up. 
So far pitching has been the biggest problem.  Maybe we can get Acker back? :-)

>But anyway the point of my post, if you missed it, was that Derek Bell was

One incident that sticks out in my mind was when Derek Bell ran back out on
to the feild after the Jays had won the division and all the players were
back in the clubhouse.  Bell ran around the field with his arms in the air,
waving a big towel over his head.  He looked like a big jerk, especially
when you consider he did not contribute much to the team over the whole
season.  The next day, Winfield and Carter somehow got the keys to Bell's
Jeep and brought it out on to the feild before the game started.  The stadium
announcer said that there was going to be a draw later in the game for Bell's
jeep.  Bell really freaked out. I don't think Bell was to popular after that.

I think that Jackson might be trying a little too hard right now.  He's known
for being a great outfielder,  and he's not the only Blue Jay who has been
booting balls and playing generally awful.

	Dummy Hoy, a late 19th-Century baseball player, was deaf.  In
order for him to be able to find out whether the pitch was a ball or
strike, the umpires developed hand signals.  This also helped to relieve
the stress on umpires' vocal cords, so they didn't have to shout ""STRIKE!!!""
or ""BALL!!!!!"" 350 times a game...

Be patient. He has a sore shoulder from crashing into the wall.
The Cards will give him all the time he needs to come around.
He is their full time centerfielder.
He will not however steal as often this year as he is hitting

I don't really mind the length of games either.  If they want to speed
the games up in sensible ways, that's fine with me too.  However, what
I object to is the assertion by baseball people (Whitey Herzog, Buck
Rodgers are who I've heard say this) that games are too long because
hitters are taking too many pitches, and that the strike zone needs to
be expanded.

Well, your idea of ""interesting"" differs from mine.  I think
batting practice is interesting, for example, and make a special
effort to get to the game very early in order to see it.  I think the
delaying tactics of batters, pitchers, catchers, and managers are
interesting because they're attempts to gain advantage through control
of the flow and timing of the game.  Of course, the umpires can, and
should, intervene when these tactics get out of hand.  As Ryan Robbins
has pointed out, there are rules that cover this.

One of the more fascinating things about baseball, I think, is its
open-endedness with regard to time.  You never know if the game is going
to zip right by and be over in less than two hours, or if it's going to
go on until four in the morning.  Likewise, some games are action-packed,
and some games are slow and lazy.  That's fine by me.  Those folks who
want constant action should watch the games on TV so they can channel-
surf and cater to their short attention spans.

I beg to differ, he had a couple 3 hit games after he came back.  He did

	Right.  I've watched enough Braves' games to know a great deal
of their players.  I like many of their players.  The only Cubs games I
get to see while living in New York are those against the Mets, and they
put me to sleep because, face it, watching guys like Rick Sutcliffe and

There are very few disciplines where 100% certainty is necessary to
state something as fact.  Baseball is not one of them.

Therefore I can say that I know Clemens was better than Morris last
year, and Larkin was better than Griffin.  No, I can't ascertain this.
I can't prove it.  But I'm not required to do so.

Wiggins, Alan?

But that's besides the point.  I'm sure people would feel slightly
sympathetic for Rickey if he were killed.  But, they would also be
criticizing him a lot more for his actions.

Example?  

How about Jose Canseco?  He gets a couple of speeding tickets, and all
of the sudden his attitude is awful.  What the hell do speeding tickets
have to do with clubhouse influence anyway?  So why do sportswriters
talk about it all the time.

Or Brian Hunter and Keith Mitchell?  Both of whom had DWI problems
towards the end of last year.  (Two years ago?)  It was cited as a sign
of their immaturity, etc.  

Meanwhile, Dykstra almost killed both himself and Daulton, and I didn't
read any sportswriter complaining about that.  They may have talked
about how bad it was for the Phillies, but I NEVER read anywhere
criticism of Dykstra's character (or Daulton's intelligence, for that
matter) based on this incident.

My father is a huge Tiger fan, and I am a loyal Blue Jay fan, who endured the collapse of 87, the heartbreak of 85.  

I don't have the stat book, so let's throw them out.

First of all, Morris in his heyday (81-88) vs Clemens (86-present).

How many Cy Youngs does Morris have?

How many Cy youngs does Clemens have?

Ballparks and such... Fenway average pitchers park.  Detroit, hugh hitters
paradise.   

Morris is a great team pitcher, sort of in the Doug Drabek mold.  
If Morris's team needs a well pitched game, as in Minn in 91, Morris
snaps the ball, and throw for Ks.  Otherwise, he just tries to get people out.

As for Clemens, in the Elias Stat Book of 1992, I believe
that Clemens has the best lifetime record for his team, as compared to
when he doesn't pitch.  How bad would the Red sox have been last year
without him?  Can you say 92 Phillies?

I believe Clemens is the better pitcher because of more power, and hsi
great tenacity.  Morris is among the guttiest pitchers I;ve ever seen,
but Clemens is in a class with Seaver, Carlton, etc.

I do, but I don't have time to type the whole thing in (I don't mind looking
up specific date ranges or individual games when I can, but there are
limits). 

Besides, this stuff is EASY to find. Baseball America puts out a book called
the Directory. It's $10(US). Has every team's data and schedule in it. If I
WERE to type in the whole scheudle, I'd just be spending a lot of time
infringing on their copyright.

Folks who are interested in the minors should check out my minor league list
(see the signature), and folks who are tracking down team schedules should
chec out the BA Directory. You can order it from 800-845-2726. I find it
indispenable.

I didn't mean that it would necessarily help him improve at that
specific deficiency.  I meant that if having Bonds bat behind him
gives Williams (possibly unfounded) confidence, that might translate
into more hitting productivity.  But you're right -- if Williams'
biggest problem is more physical than mental, that's less likely
to make a difference.

So what will happen when the tv contract runs out, considering networks
have been losing money on it?  Either ticket prices will go up, or someones
salary will be cut, or perhaps the local community or merchindise could make
up the difference.  Baseball is probably facing a dramatic drop in income
very soon, and someone will suffer (probably the fans from higher ticket
prices, but definitely someone).

But why McGwire, and not Carter?  I can see some justification for Bonds or
Thomas, because they tend to have higher batting averages, but the major
difference I see between McGwire and Carter is that Carter doesn't draw
walks.  Why aren't pitchers afraid to throw strikes to Carter?

Well, we agree on the last part.:-)  One of the basic things you need to 
have in a statistic to be able to predict a player's performance on it
in the future is for there to be a correlation from year to year.  A 
player's batting average is correlated fairly well from year to year.
A player's ability to walk or infielder's Defensive Average are correlated
better.  That is to say, given their past performance in those statistics
we can have a pretty good handle on how they'll do next year.  Put in 
some simple information about aging and you can do even better.  One of 
the basic problems with something like ""clutch"" batting average - overall
batting average is that the correlation from year to year is almost zero. 
Adding to the sample size doesn't seem to help much.  As a counterexample to 
what you showed, consider the following two players from 1984-1987:

               Non-Clutch                      Clutch
               AB      H       BA              AB      H       BA
 
Maldonado      1060    260     .245            254     78      .307
Lemon          1643    457     .278            256     57      .223

If you had had these two players in 1988, by your logic, in those ""clutch""
situations, you'd bat Maldonado for Lemon in a blink of an eye.  Well, in 
1988, Maldonado hit .267 in ""non-clutch"" and .190 in ""clutch"", while Lemon
hit .254 in ""non-clutch"" and .313 in ""clutch"".  Before you accuse me of 
completely cooking the data, there were 96 players who had 25+ ""clutch""
at bats every year from 1984-1988 (according to Elias).  As a simple
measure of clutchness, let's just look at clutch BA-non-clutch BA. If you use 
'84-'87 to predict '88 for those 96 players, you'd find that 27 of the
96 were below league average in that measure both in '84-87 and in '88,
26 were above league average in both periods and the other 43 were 
above in one and below in the other.  If you were just flipping coins,
you'd expect to get 24 above/below in both and 48 that switched.  The
difference between the observed results and the coin flip experiment
is not statisically significant.

BTW, correlating players' _overall_ batting average from '84-'87 with
'88 gives a correlation coefficient of 0.59, which is significant at
something better than the 99.9% confidence level.  Correlating their
(clutch-non-clutch BA) for the same period gives a correlation of 
0.088, significant at no level of any interest.

Actually, it's technically incorrect to say that we can't predict future
clutch performance.  It's more correct to say that we can't predict
future clutch performance with any skill.

Funny.  I didn't realize Mr. Tanner brought up Bob Knepper v. Pam Postema

Why?  If a statement is truly idiotic, and is universally thought so,
the challenge is a waste of panting.  Further, challenges that have
nothing (yes, nothing) to do with *baseball* are wasting others' time.

You got a problem with what Bob Knepper thinks?  Let's hear it, in
some sort of categorical manner.  (Actually, I question whether either
Knepper or Postema aren't ""old news"" at this point, although what I
have read of Postema's book is interesting.)

Yo.  Even elementary school children have had access to our postings,
albeit in an edited form.  You want them to hear you talk like this?
Don't you want people who come to this group to talk baseball to think
you like to do the same?  Or do you want them to think you're some 
politically correct demagogue who's oh-so sensitive?  (Ho-hum.)

Plus, you're here limiting free speech to ""some obscure newsgroup that
I don't read.""  What BS.  You got a problem with what Jacobs says, what
Knepper thinks, all you have to do is defeat it with better ideas, more
and better speech.  Yours is the easy way out.

As for Knepper: ever notice how sometimes these guys will say just about
any darn thing that pops in their heads when a mike is shoved in front of
them?  You know that often the best copy for the news is the one that isn't
pre-prepared.  They know Knepper has controversial ideas about women, they
pop some question about Postema.  (An interesting related question would 
be whether the two ever appeared in the same game.  Off the top of my head,
I guess ""no.""  If my guess is right, Knepper popped off about something that
had nothing to do with him -- and Postema gets a book for it, and he doesn't.)

	When Al Harazin first became Mets' GM, he was asked if he intended

they asked him about the orange and blue racing stripe that runs down the 
sides the uniforms.  He said that he's very much in favor of keeping them
because ""they're sleek and they're sexy"".

In the majors? I don't follow AL, so I won't comment on ""Majors"". In the NL,
if I had my choice of any 1B in the league for my team, it'd be Clark, and
I'd hit him third. (My fantasy team has both Grace and Murray on it, because
I've never been able to GET Clark. I'd take any of the three without
hesitation in real life, but I think Clark is it).

Williams: Not even close. I much prefer his defense, but when he isn't
headcasing it, Matt has a good, solid swing and some real punch. If he drops
to .230, then he wanders out of cleanup, but according to the latest
Baseball Weekly, he's hitting .275, and in the last week, hitting .296.
That's not exactly chopped liver.

Mostly, though, the Giants are winning, and frankly, as long as that
continues, it's rather silly to second-guess their strategy. But evidently,
some folks would rather be right than be first.

STATS did a little study in the 1993 Scoreboard book entitled ""Can
you hit sacrifice flies on purpose?""  A summary of the findings:

Over the 5 year period, sac-fly type fly balls were produced 17.6
percent of the time in situations where a sac fly was useful, and 
17.7 percent of the time when a sac fly wasn't useful.

They looked at the leaders in sac flies, and found that the leaders
in sac flies - in other words, the guys you would expect to be good
at it it - hit sac fly type fly balls only 3% more often when they
needed to - a difference way too small to be the result of a skill.
Essentially, the players who hit a lot of sac flies seem to do
so because they hit hit sac fly type flies often, with and without
a runner on third.

STATS concludes ""So it appears conclusive that hitters cannot hit
sacrifice flies on purpose - even if they practice in the bATTING
cage.""

This is a fine strategy if you expect to run away with the division.
But the Giants are going to need every break they can get, if they
want too hold that lead.  I don't think they can afford to be
lackadaisical, and say ""well it has worked pretty well so far, and
while we might be able to improve the results, we don't think it is
worth the risk"".

This is certainly not the case.  There is no significant *ability* toi
perform in the clutch, but clutch performance certainly happens every
time there is a game-winning hit.  The ""clutch pitching"" quoted above is
something which happened, not a claim that any particular player should
be expected to be a clutch pitcher.

Simple statistics tell me that there is a 2% chance an average clutch
hitter would have this large a split (the average decrease is 7 points,
standard deviation about 30).  There will be such hitters in any league,
just as there will be hitters who hit poorly on Tuesdays.

And there is only a very weak correlation (.01 in my best study) between
clutch hitting in the last four years and clutch hitting this year,
probably because most of the clutch data is determinaed by luck rather
than any ability.  *Based only on this data*, I don't see any reason to
pinch-hit for Sabo, or any other player who had been a poor clutch
hitter in the past.

But there are many other factors involved in a decision to pinch-hit.
Does the pinch-hitter give you a platoon advantage?  (Any portion of
Sabo's clutch split that results from his platoon split is certainly a
real ability, even if it has nothing to do with clutch hitting.)  Do you
have a singles hitter at the plate when you need a home run?  Do you
have a curveball pitcher facing a batter who has trouble with curves?

I dont know about the story but it comes from the fact that in most stadiums, the batter faces northeast and so when

Yes, but

	(a) we were talking about peak level, not career averages
and
	(b) Clemente was the best fielding RF of all time, as far
	    as anyone can tell

I did a quick scan last night, looking for players with a peak comparable
to or better than Winfield.  In my quick-n-dirty subjective judgement, you
could make good cases for Ruth, Aaron, Ott, Robinson, Clemente, Kaline, 
Maris, Klein, Jackson, Waner, and probably a few others.  This is not a
knock on Winfield, but a comment on his consistency: all of those other
players had awesome stretches and very good stretches, while Winfield has
been more uniformly excellent.  Hall of Fame?  Absolutely.  Top-10 peak?
I'm not so sure.  Top 10 total career value?  Yes, almost certainly.

Oh, yea, and Chris Bosio pitched a NO-HITTER.  One over the minimum, two
bases on ball in the first inning, one runner left, 95 pitches.  I listened
to the game on radio and listening to Dave Niehaus call the game was a
real treat (as long as they keep Ron Fairly quite, I doubt if anyone is
better than Niehaus -- but that Fairly guy is really annoying me).

But, I guess if Clemens or Viola had been pitching, it would have 
been a different story :-)

Two shutouts in two nights against the hottest, best hitting team in
Major League baseball ....  Pretty impressive in any league.

Man, if Johnson, Bosio and Hanson keep going the Mariners could be a 
really interesting team to follow this year.  Also, John Cummings (rookie)
has had three solid outings with no support.  If Fleming comes back

Sabo is clearly a better hitter than Samuel.  Yet you would pinch-hit
Samuel because you predict that Samuel will be a clutch hitter and
Sabo will be a choke hitter.  Right?  I'd call that ""predicting the
future"".

Right.  I would have used aspects of prior performance which have been
shown to be consistent in the past.  Overall performance, L/R splits,
even matching hitting/pitching styles.  All of these will give me some
advantage if used properly.

EVEN IF ALL ELSE WERE EQUAL, there would be no advantage gained by
looking at past clutch performance.  And in this case, everything else
pointed to Sabo.

That comes down to the same thing.  When Perez left Sabo in, he
was predicting the future, the next AB.  He was predicting that
Sabo was more likely to get a hit than Samuel.

By supporting the swap, you are predicting the opposite.

>And I am not dismissing your work.  I'm stating my opinion.

Well, yes.  You are aware of its existance.  You claim to be incapable
of understanding it (though I suspect you are simply unwilling).  Yet
you rather forcefully state the opposite.  You don't seem to think the
work is worth reading (yet you obviously feel the topic is important).
I'd say this is insulting.

RIGHT!  This is the beef.  It has not proven to be an indicator of
future performance under *any* circumstances.  At least none that
we've been able to come up with.  If you know of some where it *is* an
indicator of future performance, please let us in on your secret.

>It is nice, however, to see that you will consider the possibility
>that you actually could have some preconceived biases.

Most certainly.  As I have repeatedly stated, if you can come up with
a study which even *hints* at a consistent clutch ability, I would
love it!  However the straightforward attempts at such a study have
all failed miserably.

Well, it was a stupid argument.  (Are you honestly debating that???)
Sure, we know Sabo didn't get a hit.  We have no idea whether Samuel
would have done any better or not.  One AB most certainly doesn't
prove anything!

Is this simply a prediction for Chris Sabo for this year?  Or is this
a prediction for *all* batters who have, over the past few years, hit
(xxx amount?)  worse in the clutch than overall?

If you mean the first, then as you say, we'll just have to wait and
see.  But the second is a much stronger statement.  In fact, it
suggests a rule.  We can then test this rule on past data to see if it
worked for recent years.  I think you will agree that if the rule
didn't work last year or the year before, that it is unlikely to do
any better this year.  Right?

I'm not going to get into case analysis.  Sure, you can find somebody
who hit poorly from '89-'91 and then hit poorly in '92 as well.  You
can also find those who hit poorly from '89-'91 and then hit *well* in
'92.

Gambler's fallacy.  Unless there is reason to expect consistency, a
run proves nothing.  Can you give us a reason to expect clutch BA to
correlate from one year to the next?  I've seen a detailed study of
why I *shouldn't* expect it to correlate.

>""Stupid"".  ""Total idiot"".  
>
>My, my.  Such hostility.

The ""stupid"" was in reference to a statement which *was* stupid.  (And
I don't see how you can deny it.)  As for ""total idiot""?  Yes.  If you
prove yourself unwilling to even *consider* evidence that might
suggest that you are wrong, I would say the term fits nicely.

So tell me?  Does the term fit?  Or do you have an open mind?

	Yeah, maybe that is more likely.  But from the Mariners-Tigers

seem to purposely pitch around him or give him a free pass.  The 
funny thing was that Griffey was struggling up until the last game of the

	The garbage started hitting the field well before the Sunday
game.  It started on Thursday or Friday (I can't recall which games I
*didn't* watch on TBS).  Deion was getting pelted with trash the whole
time, it seemed.  The announcers talked about the change in the seating
in the bleachers, and how that made it easier for the events that

since it was a Sunday daygame the crowd would be a little different,
more refined.  Surprise?

In this morning's paper (or was it on the radio?), Vizquel was quoted as
saying that he could have fielded the ball with his glove and still
easily thrown out Riles, that he barehanded it instead so as to make the
final play more memorable.  Seems a litle cocky to me, but he made it

Hey!  What's this?  We agree!

No platoon advantage (Sabo vs. Samuel).

Both players have a reputation of being excellent fastball hitters,
	and both have a reputation of being fooled too often with
	slow curves and change ups.

Sabo has more power, and a little bit of a better batting eye.  Samuel
	is noted as an agressive free-swinger.  Sabo has more homerun power.

Both players started the game hitting below .200.  

There may have been some game considerations that might have prompted
	Perez to want to reserve Samuel for use later.  But the game
	*was* on the line, and Samuel never did get in.

Given all of this, I don't see a lot to suggest pinch-hitting, nor do
I see anything to suggest no pinch-hitting.  There is, of course, the
clutch-hitting information.  But if that's useless...

Then again.  If it's not...

Wait a minute.  If I read the rules right. A stike is ANY portion of the ball 
over ANY portion of the plate.


Given that the ball is ~ 2.9 """" in diameter.  This sez that the zone width
is ~= 17 + (2 * 2.9)  or 22.8 """" . While this is still less than the 23 ""
number given.  I can forgive any UMP for misjudging .2"" on an object moving
at 85 to 100 miles per hour many times not in a straight line.

I think the Umpires Union has a great grasp of the rules!!!

Let's be careful here.  If players' performance was completely random
in (Clutch-No Clutch), then you would still expect some players to be
good in the clutch every year and some to be not-so-good every year.
With two years worth of data, you'd have 1/4 of the players good each
year, 1/4 bad each year, and 1/2 would have one good and one bad year.
We have 96 players for 5 years ('84-'88).  Just flipping a coin, you'd
expect 3 players to be good all 5 years and 3 to be bad every year.
This is what we actually get--

No. of good years    0    1    2    3    4    5
Clutch performers    4   10   37   24   18    3
Coin flip (random)   3   15   30   30   15    3

Essentially the distribution of clutch performers by number of years
of good performance is the same as what you would get if the process
leading to deviations from non-clutch performance was completely random.
If there was anything to clutch hitting (at least in this definition)
that had any predictive capability, you expect to see the number of
players at the ends to be much larger than that predicted by flipping
a coin.  Further, if you limit yourself to players who were a lot above
or below average in clutch situations (say, 1 standard deviation from 
the mean) more than one year, the random explanation still looks good.
In the four years ('84-'87) that I looked at the data from Elias, there
were 79 (29) players with a minimum of 25 (50) at bats in clutch 
situations that were 1 sigma from the mean two different years.  Of
those 79 (29) players, 38 (14) of them changed sign between the two
years.  In other words, they were great clutch hitters one year and
really horrible the other year.  If it was just a random process, 
you'd expect those numbers to be 39.5 (14.5).  

Everything that's been measured about clutch hitting over a period
of years that could be used to predict any ability with any 
proposed definition has looked like a random process (with the 
caveat that there may be something related to platoon advantage
that could be dragged out of the data--e.g., John Lowenstein 
probably never had a ""clutch"" AB against a left-handed pitcher,
but he might well have had some in blowouts, so that there would
be a bias since his clutch ABs would be more geared to his 
platoon advantage).  This is not a subject that has been glanced
at casually.  A lot of people have put a lot of effort into 
studying it and every one of them, with the exception of the
Elias study, has been unable to find anything that would allow
you to predict how someone will do in clutch situations better
than flipping a coin.  (Self-serving plug follows:  some of the
flaws in the Elias study are discussed in my paper in the forth-
coming SABR book, _The Perfect Game_, by Taylor Publishing.  The
authors are supposed to get a slice of the advance, so go bug
your local bookstores now, and maybe I can get enough to take my
wife to dinner once.:-)

Tickets are very hard to get, even at the box office at Camden Yards.
If you really want to see a game here (I go to school in Baltimore),
price should not be an issue. Tickets go up to $15, but you should be willing
to go as high as $20-25 if you really want to come.

I had thought that Williams batted after Mitchell.  Wouldn't that show that

The point is moot, though, becase Clark pretty much demands to be 3rd

left to bat 4th is Williams.

I don't know what you were reading or watching, but I sure saw a LOT about 
that, and about Dykstra's poker games. Most of the writing was along the lines
of how incredibly stupid and selfish it was, and how he'd hurt the team by
wracking himself and the catcher up, etc. ESPN raised questions about his
judgement, etc. The print media here in the SF area questioned why disciplinary
action wouldn't be taken against Dykstra, and one article pointed out that if
Lenny wanted to kill himself, there were ways that wouldn't endanger other
people's lives. Then there was Dykstra himself being quoted on how stupid it
was, etc.

Just to add to this vein, consider that range of a first baseman is not
the only important thing.  He is IMO the best fielder of bad throws from
the other infielders.  I have seen him scoop balls out of the dirt, catch
balls off a large bounce, take down balls over his head, wide, etc. ad
infinitum.  *And* he gets the out, much of the time.  Some of the things
he does to save his infielders of errors are amazing.  You have to give
Mattingly credit for being able to do all of that while keeping his foot
near the bag (yes, I am sure he gets a few calls because he is Mattingly :-)

does anybody have the official MLB rules in electronic format?

I'm a little worried about this pitching thing.  6.08 is scarry even for
the first 16 games of the season.  Mesa (sp?) seems to be settling down. 
He pitched well against the Red Soxs, but The Rocket matched him.  I got a
chance to watch them play against California Wednesday and he pitched well
also.  Then the dam broke.  Wickander came in and promptly it was 6-1.  (3
run homer by Snow?).

I heard the guys on ESPN say that 7 of the TRIBE's top 10 prospects are
pitchers.  Anyone out there like to post who these guys are and where they
are?
The TRIBE is on ESPN again tonight against Oakland.

So, that is the reason why the Toronto Blue Jays *should* keep Alfredo
Griffin, just because it ""worked""?

A team winning doesn't mean that everything that it's doing is right.
A team not winning doesn't mean that everything that it's doing is wrong, or
otherwise (to borrow the Sharks' situation) you would say that George Kingston
should be fired.

By then, it's too late.  The problem with ""not fixing something while it's

He believed one of two things: 1) Sabo was more likely than Samuel
to get a hit OR 2) that more good would be done in the long run
by leaving Sabo in regardless of the expectation of the actual outcome.

In fact you don't know what Perez had in mind when he left Sabo in.

In fact, I don't think anyone is claiming that they can predict
the future, or any particular future event.  But we can believe
that certain trends are due to a cause (whether or not we have

If player A hits better on Tuesdays and always has, and Mark believes
that it might be an indication that he will hit on Tuesday better next
season as well, would you respond the same way?  At some point you
might admit that all variable might not be known to you (who knows
what this guy does every Monday night?  Maybe he sees his sports
shrink on Tuesday mornings, or has his Vitamin B shots Monday nights?)

But this is something that's true of one guy only.  It doesn't
mean that there will be a meaningful correlation for the entire
league by days of the week, nor that there should be.  But it doesn't
mean we can't make predictions based on that for that particular
player.

Whether you can know the reason for correlation or not, you can't
deny that it has existent, you can only make an argument that
you don't think it is likely to continue to exist because you
can't see a reason for it to exist.

The argument along the lines of star player with L/R splits will
always see an adverse condition in late innings of a close game
(i.e. opposing manager will always bring in a AH pitcher to
face him, where his manager will not pull him for a PH)

I've seen it as ""Colmn"" also.

Blame the Associated Press.  After the official scorer balances the
official score card, they copy it and give it to several diffent people. 
One of those is a person from AP whose job it is to type it up (using a
template on a laptop) and transmit it to the AP offices in New York
(Rockefeller Center) via the telephone.  The box scores are not checked
and just rebroadcasted over AP's news delivery services.  If there are
corrections, those are issued later.  It is the person sitting in front
of a laptop at Shea (or whereever) whose fault that is.  [NOTE: The AP
puts out boxscores in three different formats with the one you see in
most newspapers being the first one]

Last week they were in Denver.  Maybe the AP person in Denver did this
(remember, they just started with MLB out there).  Check tomorrow's
paper (4/21) and see if the person who is doing it from Shea does the
same thing.

Major League Baseball is trying to expand its appeal to people with shorter
attention spans (i.e. the football crowd). (-:  Invariably, all the
arguments from people who don't like to watch baseball on T.V. say the
same thing:  the games are too long and too boring.  Baseball is trying
to find a way to shorten the games for wider T.V. appeal.  If you look at
it, though, baseball games last around the same amount of time as football
games.  The difference is that there is ""more action"" in that duration in
football games.  Perhaps if there were ""more action"" in baseball games, you
would get more of those fans to tune in.  Anyway, coming up with a solution
to make baseball more appealing to a bigger crowd is going to be difficult.

Without opening this up for a sabermetric flame war, I would like to
question the notion that ""sitting a rested player down"" has any real
effect on his long-term performance.  Sure, if a man is tired and needs
real rest, then taking a break might be a constructive act.  Perhaps if
a man is mentally ""strained"", then sitting him down might help to the
extent that that helps him relax.  But I would like to suggest that
in the long run, players do slump, and benching is probably irrelevant.

funny, it seems to me that the stats major league and minor league handbooks,
which are nothing BUT collections of statistics, are authored by ""bill james
and stats inc. (and howe, for the minor league handbook)"".

and i am not sure how the 1993 bill james player ratings book qualifies
as a ""book with statistics"", while the elias analyst is a ""statistics book"".
the analyst contains more stats, sure, but it also contains more dialogue.

finally, the point was not about the word ""statistics"".  it was about
""money-grubbing"".  i don't see how anyone who has looked at the bill
james player ratings book cannot consider him money-grubbing.

I really don't want to get into a DidSo-DidNot debate with you.  But
this is somewhat at the heart of our disagreement.  I did not say, 
nor did I imply, that I could predict the future.  You have inferred
that my comments meant this, and you have based your rebuttal of my

there is no reasonable basis for predicting future performance in

That is *your* opinion that Sabo is ""clearly a better hitter"" than
Samuel.  The above data is for a 4-year period ending last season.
Last season Samuel batted .272 while Sabo hit .244 (not park adjusted).
This season they are both hitting below .200, albeit Sabo with more
at bats.  I will agree that over his career Sabo has been a better
hitter than Samuel, but I will also remind you that Samuel has been
a better hitter in certain situations than Sabo.

I did not predict that Sabo would choke, nor that Samuel would get a
hit.  I expressed my opinion that had I been the Reds manager (or
even a Reds fan) that I would prefer to have Samuel hit in that
situation than Sabo.

Please help me.  What, exactly, is ""everything else"" that pointed to Sabo?

And I guess I must apologize to all of those who have done extensive

Well, actually, I haven't yet.  But I'm not finished looking.
That is, I haven't yet found someone who hit significantly below
his overall batting average in clutch situations for the years 
1989 - 91, and then reversed that relationship in 1992.

Nope.  Sorry.  But if you were interested in a reason why I expect
Chris Sabo's ability to hit in the clutch to correlate from one
year to the next, I think I could.  If you were interested in a
reason why I expect Joe Carter's ability to hit in the clutch to
correlate from one year to the next, I think I could.  But you're
not interested in that, because you think that those conclusions
could only be valid if they could be extrapolated over the entire
baseball population.  And they can't be.

The problem here is that I *do* believe you.  I accept your work.
I believe that trying to predict future clutch performance based
on prior clutch history is meaningless.  No better than a coin toss.
I actually *do* accept your work.

As it happens, I also have an *opinion* that in certain situations,
for certain players, a history of superior or inferior ability to
hit in the clutch might suggest a reason what such history could be
valid in projecting future player performance.  For that player.
And Chris Sabo is one such player.


>So tell me?  Does the term fit?  Or do you have an open mind?

Well, since I defer to your statistical wisdom, I think I must have
an open mind.  Now we have to pose the same question to you.

[detailed explanation deleted..]


Indeed, you have struck right at the heart of our disagreement. To 
rebut my opinion, you have made an analogy with a game of chance.
Your hypothesis assumes that the Lotto players have no impact on
the selection of the numbers, and hence their ability to win.

Well, that's certainly true in Lotto.  But it has absolutely
NOTHING to do with the sport of baseball.  When you start down
the wrong path, you finish down the wrong path.





I repeat.  I do not think that statistical analysis of prior clutch
hitting performance is an accurate predictor of future clutch hitting
performance.

I do, however, think that analysis of prior clutch hitting performance
may, for some players, indicate a deficiency in their game that indeed
will provide a basis for projecting their particular future performance.
And I think Chris Sabo is such a player.

I'll post my guesses to some of these and other trivia questions posted.

For most career K's with one team, if it's not Ryan, perhaps Steve Carlton.
With the Rangers, Hough was there for a long time.

In the 100 saves department...Maybe Lee Smith(he should have at least
a hundred with the Cubbies, maybe enough with either the RSox or Cards.)
Then maybe, Gossage?(NYY and SD), Fingers (MIL, OAK)

Don't know about the homers/steals dept.

In some other article,(Mets trivia), it could be Tim Leary in at least
the losing to all teams, maybe beating all of 'em too.  Probably Seaver
and Koosman fit too.

And in Randy Johnson's no-hitter, I think it was Scott Bradley, the
other half of the old Mariner catching platoon, who was behind the plate
that night.

Still, if the 'whispers' reached San Francisco, it is certainly possible they

Uh, the original author's point was that black and white players were por-

list to ""prove"" his case. Sanders' name showed up eventually. I dispute that
Sanders has ever been called lazy by ""the media"".

Uh, that poster specifically stated ""allow me to be the first"". It is NOT a
quibble, then, to state that ""the media"" did not portray Canseco as being 
lazy. If the other person chooses to so accuse him, after my post, that does not
make it a quibble. And in fact, the media around here tend(ed) to play up his
time in the wieght room. Hardly ""lazy"", and hardly a ""quibble"". Have you ever

Lazy, no.

Well, Canseco has been involved in several felonies, including his high-speed
record, carrying concealed fire-arms, and of course the domestic violence. 
Clemens had a run-in at a bar. Canseco had that, as well, and in both cases, the
coverage was relatively minimal.

Uh, yes, and I agree with your assesment of Boggs, rather specifically. However,
you did say ""everybody who has ever won a batting title"" has been accused of
selfishness. I have not ever, anywhere, heard this said of Puckett. Pendleton,
either. Similarly, Brett, B Williams, and others.

There are others. Perhaps they are simply not as outspoken, except in the

Was it just me, or did it look like Hirschbeck pointed to

why Gant was asking for the appeal to the 1st base umpire;
he thought Hirschbeck had gotten checked-swing help from the wrong

Your listing pretty much agreed with what I saw, with the aforementioned
addendums.  Perhaps it appeared differently at the ballpark.  Personally,
I was amazed that Gant didn't get ejected.  But that's why Cox did;
it's called protecting your players.

And to those people who would have thrown everyone out of the game,
all I can say is that you'd be making baseball history.  Even in
the worst baseball brawls, usually only the major instigators are
ejected, not everyone who comes onto the field.  And I'd have to 
say that those brawls are considerably more threatening to the game
 than what the Braves did Fri. night.

Anyhow, that's my last two cents on the subject, barring
outrageous postings.  I will try to keep my eyes open
for more incidents involving Hirschbeck. I think there will
be some with other teams as well.  I hope not.

If it encouraged the runner to stretch his lead, it would probably
also result ina greater number of pickoffs. I think it would be a
workable rule, but it would probably be best to experiment in another
league before trying it in the bigs.

Velarde hasn't been to Columbus, if I recall, for about three
years.  Granted, he hasn't been a full time player but
when he does play I've always thought he had a good bat.
He might be demoralized about not playing full time, but
he hasn't been shuttled around.  I think he's been in New York
ever since he had 34 hits in 100 AB back in 1989, or 90, I
believe.  
I don't think he is gold glove calibre, but he doesn't boot
it around either.  I think if Velarde is given a chance,
he could become extremely productive.  I don't have any stats
to back this up, and I don't know if his Defense would
cost any games, but I think he could help - and he has
this year.  He has 3 HR already.  Same goes for
Jim Leyrtiz.  He has a big mouth, but he does get
the job done when he concentrates.  I think the situation
with Leyritz is that he believes he is a potential
super-star, and he gets pissed about not playing.  I
think he might have realized something when the Marlins
or Rockies didn't select him.
The Yanks need to worry about the Bullpen right now.
Kamieniecki and Wickman/Militello in the bullpen?

Sorry, I still don't buy it.  You're certainly right that the runner is
not out merely for running out of the baseline: he must interfere with
the play.  But the argument here is over what constitutes interference.
You certainly cannot infer from what you've quoted that the batter-runner
must be hit by the ball to be guilty of interference: you haven't posted
a definition of interference at all.

IMO this calls for one of the ""approved ruling[s]"" that go in small print
in the rulebook.  Something like:

APPROVED RULING:
If in the judgement of the umpire the runner, by running to the left
of the allowed path, caused the fielder to make a bad throw, blocks the
vision of the fielder receiving the throw, or otherwise impedes the
defensive team's making a play on him, the batter-runner shall be
judeged guilty of interference.

or

APPROVED RULING:
The runner cannot be judged guilty of interference in the unless he makes
contact with a fielder or is hit by the thrown ball.

--
In the absence of such an approved ruling I claim that this is a poor
rules trivia question--since it cannot be authoritatively answered.

Yes, that's him.  Was I not specific enough?

Just because someone consistently pulls the ball does not mean that
they have a quick bat.  Dawson's release is slow, and he *IS* 38, after
all.  He may swing early, and rotate his hips so that he hits the ball to 
the left side all the time, but he swings slowly.

Hi there,

      I was wondering if anyone knew if John Wetteland was put on the DL again
      after his first 15-day period was up? I read in the USA Today Sports 
      section that he is on for ""surgery to repair broken toe"", and was
      wondering if that was new. I thought he was just letting it heal. 

      Another question, Is Derek Lilliquist the main closer for the Indians now
      that Olin is gone. I need to know cause I need to find a reliever to 
      replace Wetteland and so far Lilliquist is doing ok. Any information on
      either of the players would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your
      time.

Well, they just said that Franco will probably go on the DL tomorrow.
(They mentioned a career minor leaguer as the ""warm body"" who would go 
along...I forget.)

Also, when answering questions about the rotation, Coleman (SD 
broadcaster) said that Hurst is gone in about a month-month and a half, 
which is when he should finish re-hab.

Huh?  The 20's and 30's were the *worst* decades for great pitching.  Grove,
Vance, Dean, and not a whole lot else.

That's the trouble: *what* peak years?  He wavers between excellent and
very good, with no real bell-shaped pattern in there.  1979 was a fine
year; 78 and 80 were merely really good.  With the Yankees, 84 (I think)
was the best; that was the one with the .340 BA.  

Of course, 1992 wasn't bad, either.  He's been in the bigs since 1973,
with a one-year intermission for surgery.  Though he doesn't have the
mix of skills that Pete Rose did, he's like Pete Rose in one way: he's 
not a natural hitter.  Winfield's swing used to be the ugliest thing
in New York, and that includes the Gulf+Western Building.  But his sheer
athletic prowess and physical size made up for a lot.  

Fascinating player to watch, even now.  Not obviously great in any one
way; but able to do quite a few things in surprising ways and at surprising
levels.

The major problem with this analysis is that it ignores age.  Even if
Morris were performing as well as Clemens right now, and were likely to
this season, nobody would trade Clemens for Morris straight up because
Clemens has more of his career left.

NPR this morning had an interview with Linda McCarthy (name possibly
garbled by me), an official historian for the CIA.  She has won an Emmy
for research on Moe Berg for a TV documentary (which I know from nothing
but which sounds good).  She said that among other things, Berg was the 
principal spy for the OSS (CIA's WWII precursor) spying on Axis atomic
programs, because of his physics background and language skills.  She said
that during the war he met with Heisenberg in Switzerland, and had 
instructions to shoot Heisenberg if the Germans were close to us in bomb
research (he concluded they were two years behind, and didn't shoot him).
(I have heard elsewhere that Heisenberg deliberately misled the Nazi bomb
program, but I don't know how reliable this is.)  Unfortunately, NPR didn't
mention any kind of a book she's writing -- I'd certainly buy it.

(In case you're wondering about baseball relevance, Berg was a longtime
MLB backup catcher.  He was a member of an MLB All-Star team that toured
Japan in 1934, presumably not because of his baseball prowess but because
he was one of the few Americans, much less MLB players, who spoke Japanese.
Photos he took of Tokyo on that trip were later used to plan bombing raids,
according to McCarthy.)

This comes up periodically, and I just don't get it. Take, for example, Mark
McGwire. He walked 90 times in 1993. If that's not a potential great example
of what you're talking about then I don't know what is. Now let's look at
what happens when McGwire doesn't walk:
  75% of the time he made an out.
  10% of the time he hit a single.
  5% of the time he hit a double.
  10% of the time he hit a homer.
Now, you're pitching against McGwire. Would you trade 20 walks for 2 homers,
1 double, 2 singles, and 15 outs? I would. Why give him the base when you
can get him out 3 times out of 4?
Then there are guys like Alex Cole, who has a career .363 OBP even
though he's never had a batting average over .300 (he did hit .300 in
227 AB in 1990) or hit a single home run. Yep, that's right, he's
*never* hit a homer in 916 AB's through the end of 1992. Who'd be
afraid to throw a strike to him?

A HBP, but it reminds of my favorite (apochryphal ? sp ?) Don Drysdale story.

When ordered to intentionally walk a batter who had hot-dogged on him in
two previous at-bats, Drysdale reared back with the first pitch and
drilled him right in the ribs.

His manager came storming out of the dugout and yelled ""What did you do that
for ?""

Drysdale growled back, ""What are you complaining for ? I saved you three
pitches !""

Incidentally, if this is true, I'd love to know the other people involved.

I know it's very trendy nowadays to dump on Morris, but let's give credit
where credit is due.

It is doubtful that the blue jays would have won the AL east without Morris.
Last year, when the team went 13-15 for the month of August, and all the 
other starters were being shelled, and Milwaukee was making a charge,
Morris went 5-1 with a pretty good era (I can't remember exactly).
Also, let's not underestimate the importance his 240+ innings to save 
the bullpen every fifth day.  If he didn't help us win the AL east, forget
about the pennent and the world series.

His run support was high (5.98 runs) but so was Stottlemyer's (5.90 runs)
and he won only 12 games.  I do remember Morris winning an inordinate number of
6-5 and 8-6 ballgames, but this is to his credit.  He pitched only as good
as he needed to be.  When he was up 6-1 in a ballgame, he just put it in cruise
control and threw the ball up there and let the batters ""get themseleves out""
(I hate this expression!).  An inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out 
trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down.  But Morris, being a 
veteran pitcher, knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in
baseball.  By saving himself, he was able to reach back for that little extra
(I hate this too!) when the game was on the line.

Yes Morris is crapping out big time this year, but let's not change history
to suit the present.  

BTW, I think he should be put in the bullpen; it would be embarrassing a 
veteran pitcher which Cito would never do, but his era is 17+, how much more
can he be embarrassed?

DJ was a popular player in San Diego, Derek Bell was not faring well in the
clubhouse at Toronto, so no matter how bad he looks now I still think it
was a steal for the Jays just from the perspective of team chemistry.
No statistic can describe it (sorry statheads) and since there are so many
new faces in the clubhouse I think the Jays are still trying to find it.

(Insert the same comment into the Jack Morris v. Clemens WS Ring string)

Yet at first I was sad to see Derek go, still anticipating all of the talent
they raved about at the beginning of last season.  I'm glad to see him
faring well for the Padres though.

I remember a post from last year indicating that a ""pitch clock"" was tried
in one of the minor leagues some time back and did not work.  I don't remember
why they said that it did not work.  Anyone remember this?

Jody McDonnel on WIP in Phil. has been saying that a pitch clock was
inevitable.  How would a pitch clock work on throws to first?

Another pair of suggestions:
1. Remove the Balk rule.  It is the runners responsibility to stay ""safe""
   no matter what the pitcher does.

2. If a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than X time (X = 3 to 5)
   without successfully picking off the runner, the runner advances a base
   as if walked.

The no-balk seems to give the pitcher the advantage.  The base-walk allows
the runner to ""challenge"" pitcher to throw over to the base.

  Ok, Roger, here's a question for you.  Say you are running an expansion
team.  You don't HAVE a team at the moment, but the draft is coming up.  Who
are you going to pick, guys who have won the most WS rings, or guys who 
COULD contribute the most to your team.  Say the Reds were dumb enough to 
not protect Larkin, and the Jays didn't protect Alfredo.  Who would you
pick?

  I really think that this is the key point.  When I saw the incident on
Baseball Tonight Sunday, I couldn't believe how far away from the plate
Gant went.  Then he casually leaned against his bat.  I don't blame the 
umpire at all for telling the pitcher to pitch.

  The worst part of the whole incident was the Braves coming out onto the
field.  What were they going to do, attack the umpire?  The only people
who should've been out there were Cox and maybe the coaches, but NO players.
I agree with the person who posted before that Cox should be suspended for
having no control over his team.

I hesitate to make assumptions about other people when they write, but
neither of you two *sound* as though you have kids, and you may not have
spouses either.

Consider a night game starting at 7:05 PM EST.  (It was 7:35 last year,
but Cleveland showed what I thought was good sense in pushing it back.)
I go, and I'm into it until 11 PM minimum.  Extra innings could put me
well past midnight.  Even without extra innings, if the score is beyond
2-1 I can't see my family that night at all.  If the next day is a workday,
I may have to bag that as well.  Further, the later the game goes, the
colder it gets on the shore of Lake Erie.

All that stuff enters into my consideration of even going to a game.  If
you say you don't care about whether the game is sped up, IMPO you are 
saying you don't care where the time goes, and that the game is for people
who don't have families and don't have to get up for work the next day.

I grew up listening to Harry Carey call the Cardinals' games and

he was too critical (read: honest) when he was announcing. He

Pitchers are required to pitch (or feint or attempt a pick-off)
within 20 seconds after receiving the ball, not 15.

Pitchers are required to pitch their warm-up throws within a
one minute time frame, beginning after each half inning ends,
not two minutes.

And the reason why a reliever should be allowed warm-ups is
simple: Different mound, different catcher.

All of these Czechs (Kadlec, Dolezal not anymore) are very good hockey
players. It is a big surprise that Hlinka selected Dolezal. 
""Dole"" had a bad season in JyPHT and that's why they didn't make
a new contract. The other Czech we had, Jiri Jonak, got fired also.

The only way to change ESPN's thinking, if it is even possible, is to complain
to them directly.  Anyone know there telephone # in Bristol, Ct?  

I do find it hard to believe that ESPN doesn't think viewers will simply
change the channel from a boring game....I know I did.  And then, when
they didn't show the NYI-Wash overtime(s), I was livid!  If I wanted
to watch baseball, I could have turned on the Phillies-Padres extra
inning game....instead, I went to bed angry......I boycotted ESPN's
morning Sportscenter today, I was still so incensed.

My wife says I shouldn't go to bed angry, but last nite.........GRRRRRRR!

Have no fear, Doug, the Bruins are toast. Statistically, only 2 teams

I didn't mean to imply that Gund's offer wasn't enough.  Gund's offer
was the right $, but too late in the season.  $2M offered in November
lets Sather buy a replacement for Murphy *this* season and make the
playoffs *this* year. $2M in March doesn't help Sather with his
immediate objectives, doesn't help with long term objectives (only a
prospect or draft pick does, and no way should the Sharks do that).
However, getting back to what-if games, had Kisio been traded to
Chicago last year, then the Sharks go 0 for October, and maybe Gund
panicks sooner in November. And here's another what-if twist: Chicago
would have had Kisio this season; they *never* go after Murphy in the
first place because Kelly is having his *best* season (bigger guys in
Chicago). So Gund has no competition. So Ferriera, Sather, and Keenan
all look like geniuses.

A broken fax machine, and Ferriera, Keenan, and maybe Kingston
(and maybe even Green) lose their jobs. Kind of makes you
shiver doesn't it. :-)

Bottomline, for every black scenario any of you can concoct for
Kisio leaving, I can concoct an equally bright one.

I've been a loyal ticket holder, since day 1 (literally) in spring of

I would argue Gerald, that Bowman is the first ""modern"" coach.
Bowman's Canadiens were the first NHL team to have a weight-room
in the 70s.  He is the first coach I have seen, that manipulates
the press into spreading false game plan rumours.  (During important games
listen to the pre-game interview will Bowman and compare that to
what is on the ice!)  I agree Bowman is a master of the lineups. 
Remember last year in the SC when he benched Jagr only to set him free 
in OT.  When Jagr banged in the winning goal I thought this was
trademark Bowman and also a sign of a modern coach!

I am left asking ""What is a modern coach if not Bowman?""

Whoa.  What you are effectively doing is implying that if a player plays
really well, he 'stores up' mistakes that can be used at a later time.  Ths
is not so.  Roy is the 'villain', as you so succinctly put it, because he
allowed a very cheap goal.  If you think Roy outplayed Hextall, perhaps you
should get a tape of the game and watch the first 7-8 minutes of the third
period.  NHL goaltenders _make_ some great saves.  If they did not, they
would not be in the NHL in the first place.  I do not expect any particular
goalie to be able to make the great saves all of the time, even though they
are occasionally required.  However, when it comes to a routine shot like
Sakic's, especially at such a crucial time in a game, I don't think there 
are any legitimate excuses. 

>Hextall, on the other hand, had a lot of lucky bounces 
>[description of lucky bounces.....]
>Hextall wasn't particularly brilliant on those plays ... 

I am not arguing that Hextall was brilliant.  I am arguing is that a
relatively weak wrist shot from the outside of the circle shold not result 
in a goal. 

> ... but it was just the 1 goal. The timing stank, but against
>an explosive team like Quebec, they gave them 1 opportunity too many with
>a powerplay that was totally unnecessary.

In a one-goal game with less than a minute to go there is no such thing as
'just the 1 goal'.  I have not defended Dionne for taking the penalty
either...in fact I think it was a boneheaded move.  But it led to _one_ goal
only, and Montreal had a _two_ goal lead.  My main concern is the second 
goal.

>This most certainly was a team loss... Leclair missed his opportunities,
>as did Bellows and Brunet. Dionne took a bad penalty. Damphousse and Lebeau
>were *silent*. Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night. Roy gave
>up the bad goal. Roy, by no means, can be singled out for this loss.

What you say about the skaters is absolutely true.  But realize that the 
game was effectively *won*.  You could watch any hockey game (in fact, you
could watch any sporting event period) and spend hours discussing the 'what
if's' w.r.t. missed opportunities.  They are not important when the final
result is decided.  If I get the time soon, I'll watch the game again and
email you a list of lucky Montreal bounces and a list of Quebec offensive
screwups.  Montreal was _leading_ with a minute to go.  The goalie
is the last line of defence, and I will grant that extra attention is
focussed on him, sometimes without justification.  But Roy gave up a *lousy*
goal, and a team cannot afford such a goal.

>>Roy looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.

>And Hextall didn't on Dionne's goal? Please. 

WHO CARES?  Of what value is it to justify one lousy play with a totally
unrelated lousy play?  I could do a Hextall critique if you'd like.  But if
you're going to assess his performance, keep in mind that he made the key
saves at the key times.

>Roy is paid big money because
>that is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5

For the record, I did not say that Roy was not one of the top goaltenders in
the league.  In fact, I agree that he is.

>The Montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory
>comments against the Habs. They are no better than uninformed fans.
                            
I assume you are referring to me.  However, I have pointed out that I think
the loss can be blamed on Roy.  I have not said he sucks, nor do I think I've
made any other 'derogatory comments'.  If you regard objective
(and informed, FYI) observations as derogatory, I really can't help you.

Hopefully EPSN will use the lesson given by the master: Ted Turner.
The season Ted introduced TNT, many cable co.'s refused to put it on,
saying that, gee we get enough old movies, miniseries, etc. on TBS,
USA, AMC, WGN, WOR, why do we need another one? This was in the fall.
Come spring, Ted fixed their little red wagons good. The previous
spring, NBA playoffs wore on TBS, now they were on TNT (and still are).
And everyone gets TNT now.

So, ESPN should put NFL football and baseball on ESPN2, and leave
hockey on ESPN. And if cable co.'s play games and drop ESPN
in favor of ESPN2, ESPN should alternate baseball and football between
channels every week.

But, do the ESPN guys collectively have the gonads of the Turner guy?

  The Leafs should have kept Fuhr, and probably would have had a chance

He's a Canadian ""thing"". Former coach of the Boston Bruins and Colorado
Rockies. From the summaries that get posted I gather that his ongoing beef
this year has been the conventional wisdom that Canadian hockey is doomed
to be second or third rate behind the perceived emergence of the U.S.
and European programs.

After he left the Rockies, he got a job with CBC's Hockey Night in Canada
and hasn't looked back since. Actually, he did work for CBC at least
on playoff season after the Rockies were eliminated.

I'd say it's a combination of flame bait and serious journalism. The closest
thing you'll find to Cherry in the U.S. is Stan Fischler, a self-described
hockey maven. The similarities are that they both say things that get
people upset. The difference is that Cherry knows the game and Fischler
doesn't.

>ass.  Let me know - maybe I'm missing something.

Don's a character. If he were completely rational and noncontroversial
he wouldn't have a job. By some definitions, he could be called an ass.
But then some people feel the same about Mike Lang, another character that
I wish would get wider exposure (only one national telecast last year).

I'd much rather see the Bruins in the Wales Conference finals vs. Pitt than
Buffalo or Quebec, if only because it would be more interesting.  Not that
Buffalo or Quebec can't put up a good fight, but I'd much more enjoy a 7-0

I have to agree wholeheartedly with this view.  I don't like to see stickwork,
but you have to clear players away from in front.  My personal favorite move
(I'm a goalie too) is to give the offeding player a good whack on the back
of their skates when the ref isn't looking.  Makes 'em go down like a ton of
bricks, but doesn't cause injuries unless they don't know how to fall (I'm 
talking about hitting the blades here, not the foot).  It also makes the 
player you hit and anyone who sees really mad and apt to take a stupid
retaliation penalty.  Unfortunately, it also leaves your blocker out of 
position for a short time...I don't do this if a shot is likely on the short
side.  Hmm....maybe I should mail Potvin this method (in French and with
helpful diagrams, of course).  It sure would be nice to see Ciccerelli (who
I have a great deal of respect for, BTW, he's not a big guy, but he plays
huge!) fall on his back a few times!  :-)

""They're real and they're spectacular"", the Blues shutout the Blackhawks in
consecutive playoff games. 

If the Blues sweep the Hawks on Sunday, I will launch a broom onto the ice
in the last seconds of the game. ""Not that there's anything wrong with that.""

Curtis Joseph has been the ""master of his own domain"", and the Hawks have
been shooting the puck like a bunch of ""chuckers"". Not even ""Superman"" could
play any better in goal. Joseph must have been eating his ""cereal.""

""It's like a sauna in here"" said a spectator about the hot atmosphere and
the wild crowd at the Arena.

It was ""very refreshing"" to see the Blues ""double-dip"" the Hawks.

The Hawks goons tried to ""pick"" on Hull, Janney, and Joseph but the Blues
checking line ""nipped"" those Hawks real well.

The fat ""Yoyoma"" will sing on Sunday, and the Hawks will head to the ""beach"".
The Hawks' trip back to Chicago will feel like a long ""journey from Milan
to Minsk""

Enjoy Sunday's game with some Junior Mints and wash them down with a Snapple.

Just a little fun.

According to ""Quotations from Chairman Cherry"", Don was playing in
Springfield. He and another player had to pay some fines; the other
player had his paid off, but not Don didn't want to.

Don called the other player a ""teacher's Pet"", and the other player
replied ""Ah, that's just sour grapes"".

Don't know how accurate that is, but that's what's printed.

Some people in the discussion group, as well as ""commentator Al"" on ESPN, 
believe that game 3 is critical for the Sabres.  HELLOOOO!!!!! The Sabres 
are AHEAD 2 games to 0, not behind.  As a life-long Sabres fan, I am well 
aware of their ability to choke, but let's not exaggerate that.  As long as 
the Sabres win one of the next 2 games (be it game 3 OR game 4), they are 
still in good shape (ahead 3 games to 1), with game 6 to be played at 
Buffalo.  If they lose games three AND four, then start worrying.  Game 3 is

Nntp-Posting-Host: swanlake.cs.ualberta.ca
Organization: University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada
Lines: 83




Here's a summary of Don Cherry's Coach's Corner from April 21, 1993.
The game being broadcast in my region was LA and Calgary, although
I think it was filmed during the Toronto-Detroit game that night.

(Warning... Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post.)

Topics
------

Don's Tie, Grant Fuhr, Penalties, Wings vs Leafs, Fighting, Dale Hunter.

Episode Summary
---------------

This episode began with the camera zoomed in on Don's tie. Don was
pointing out the characters on the tie... Bugs Bunny, Foghorn Leghorn,
and Yosemite Sam (who Don called Lanny Macdonald.)

Ron Maclean began by mentioning that Don was almost evicted from a
hotel where he was watching the previous night's games, because of
all the yelling and cheering he was doing over the play of Hunter
and Fuhr.

Don began to praise Fuhr, calling him the ""greatest goalie"", and
said that he's winning the series against Boston all by himself.
He then showed clips from earlier episodes (Nov. 14, Jan. 16) when
Fuhr was still with the Leafs, and Don advised ""Don't Trade Fuhr!""

Don went on to predict that if Buffalo gets by Boston, it would
be Fuhr who wins the series. Muckler took a lot of heat for the
trade, but Don feels Muckler's been vindicated.

The next topic involved how playoff games are being ruined by
too many penalty calls. He showed a clip from a Winnipeg-Vancouver
game, where Domi hit a Vancouver player, and was given a 2 min. penalty.
Ron said that it was called a penalty because his stick was involved,
but Don stuck with the opinion that it was a good hit, with Domi
hitting the Vancouver player with his shoulder. Don: ""Its sad what
they're doing for hockey... a 5 minute penalty for a nosebleed.""

Next, they went to the playoff series between Detroit and Toronto.
People in Detroit were calling Wendel Clarke ""Wendy"" for not fighting.
However, Don pointed out that Probert was not fighting either.

This lead Don into a tirad about fighting and stickwork, and how
banning fighting leads to more high sticking: ""It's like college
hockey... The little wee guy with the visor is brave as anybody.
That's why you're seeing so much stickwork. Because they know you
won't drop your gloves and give them a shot. The rules are made
by people who don't know what's going on in hockey"".

The final topic Don discussed was Dale Hunter. Don pointed out
that he was leading the league in goals, and showed a clip
of Hunter from a previous game. When he was younger, Hunter was
taught to ""play to win"", which differs from today's idea of
just letting kids have fun.

At then end of the episode, they showed a clip from a coach's
corner, with the tape on fast forward, so that Don sounded like
one of the chipmunks.

Rating
------
Typical anti-fighting posturing, not too much humour, but some
good quotes.

I'd give it a 7.0 out of 10.

I would appreciate it if someone could volunteer to verify the shots on goal
and save percentage numbers for me, so I can put these stats on the archive
site.  Contact me by mail if you want to volunteer.

Here are the individual goalie stats as of: Wed Apr 21 09:09:38 CST 1993

These stats include games up to and including the Sunday previous to the date
listed above.  They have been verified against what is printed in my newspaper
every Tuesday.  They don't print shots and save percentage numbers, so those
are not verified.  These stats are available by mail every weekday and
sometimes on weekends, if I'm in town and I can get late game results.  Just
send me a note if you would like to receive these stats by mail.

If you have any questions, comments or suggestions, let me know.

Exactly my point.  If you'd watch games more closely, you'd see a lot 
of goons going after him.  Ulf is one of the main reasons why less physical 
players for Pgh are left alone.  Ulf plays rough hockey, but only when 
other players are putting the rush on Mario or Jagr.  If you want to say anyone
on the Penguins is a cheap shot or a goon, say it's Jennings or Caufield.  Don'tslander a good defenseman because your favorite players can't beat the Pens
even when they take dives (like Gartner) to try for the cheap penalties.

Hey, that's fine!  If a player does something stupid, he should be penalized
including Ulf.  Or Mario (you're not likely to see that happen) or anyone else for that matter.  It's pointless to say any one person is a cheap-shot goon,     because you'll see EVERYONE take a cheap shot now and then, especially if you'resomeone who is shadowed as much as Ulf is.

Not nearly as angry as I was to have set the VCR yesterday only to get
home to find the Bruins VS Buffalo - that's what I get for reading the
TV section and not the sports section for what game will be aired.

Disaster! Finland was beaten by Czech 1-3 (0-0,1-1,0-2).
Finland will be 4th of pool B and will most certainly meet Canada in the
quarter final on wednesday 28th. Lack of scoring skills has
been the major problem of team Finland throughout the tournament.
Briza (goalie)  was the MVP of  the Czech team and Tikkanen was the 
MVP of the Finnish team.

He's been out, but he isn't injured.  He played well when he was put into the lineup at the end of the season - Murray has to sit somebody out, though.  If the Red Wings hadn't played as well as they did in the first game, he may have been in the second.  Why should Murray juggle players when the Wings are dominating Toronto like they are?

I think Joe Kocus should play every night.   He is a big physical guy, and  
he gets the fans into the game with some big hits.  (both checks and  
fists)  Its a big advantage to get the crowd going.  Plus, he helps  
protect the other players.  Notice there are very few fights when Kocur is  
on the ice unless he is it.  I have seen people start to go after essa  
Tikkanen, only to go slinking away when Kocur steps in.  I think he is big  
asset, but should be third line, and special situation only play.

 Marcus Thuresson had 6 goals, 10 assists, 16 points and 22 PIM in 31 games
 this season for Leksand in the Swedish elite league. This was only 10th
 in point scoring for Leksand.

 Marcus (born May 31 1971, Ht 185 cm, Wt 85 kg) is relatively young so he
 might still start producing, but I think the Sharks may have done a bad
 trade here.

Yes, these last couple of months the Kinngs have failed to show up in about
one game in five. Presumably last night was that one game in five.

You, along with Mario Lemieux, must be from another planet.  The only
difference is that Lemieux comes from the one with Geo. Washington, Abe
Lincoln (and many other great men and women of this world) whereas you come
from the one with David Koresh.  Yeah, Mario is good at drawing penalties,
but wouldn't you try do something (you do claim to play) to give your team
an advantage?  I don't remember Lemieux getting any diving penalties this
year, whereas many others did.  Finally, Mario has NEVER complained about
being hit.  He knows it's part of the game; he gets back by dishing out an
even bigger hit to the same guy or just scoring a few goals (or setting
them up.)  Don't you have any compassion for a man who has gone through so
much in his life?

ESPN has been trying various things to get away from the
follow-the-puck concept of televising hockey games.  One of the main
problems with hockey is that it is very difficult to show everything
that is going on -- more happens away from the puck than in any other
sport except maybe football and they can do iso's on football players
to be shown between plays.

The problem of course is that sometimes you get something worthwhile,
other times you get burned.

Not to Sutter bash or anything since I idolized them as players....
you sure would think the Sutters would learn something about burning out their
teams in the regular season.....just too much intensity during the regular 
season.  I earlier posted a note about Brian and got to thinking after I read
this item.....gee both Sutters won their divisions and now both have lost 
home ice advantage and are getting smoked in their opening series in the
playoffs.  Kind of makes you wonder.......

Bottom line....man it is great to be smoking the WartHawks!!!!!
Agreed Jim.....this has been damn sweet, so far.  About the only thing
that comes close to this is shutting up all the Maple Laugh fans....Detroit
has completely kicked their asses so far.  But, I will stick with the
Blues for providing the best playoff tonic so far.

Subject: Playoff consecutive loss record?
Lines: 20

With the recent demise of the Chicago Blawkhawks (much to my delight) I
noticed their 8 (?) game playoff losing streak (4 to the Pens last year, and
now 4 to the Blues) and I am wondering what the NHL record for consecutive
losses is, if there even is one...

I'm pretty sure that the Hawks have at least a 9 game losing  streak, since
they've had to have lost a series since their last championship (whenever that
was)

Basically, I need something else to rag on my Hawks-fan friend with :)

Well, as a hockey fan, I think it's terrible. It's one thing to say, ""Hey, 
let's give a hockey team to cities that don't have one!"" -- that's fine. It's
entirely another to say, ""Okay, let's take a team from a thriving hockey town
and move it!"" 

Of course, none of us will ever know the real inside story, but
from what I know, a group of Minneapolis businessmen told Green repeatedly that
they would purchase the remaining 3600 (?) season tickets to get to the 10,000
level that Green wanted, yet he refused every time. It's pretty obvious that he
was determined to get out of Minneapolis at any cost and use the season tickets
thing as an excuse. 

I was fortunate enough to get to the penultimate game, and
the fans were great! People were tailgating and playing roller hockey in the
parking lot before the game, the attendance was so full as to have SRO, and the
whole atmosphere in the Centre was terrific. Minnesota IS Hockey, USA. How the
NHL can so blithely let the major league team from there move away is beyond 
me. I only hope they get a new team soon.

Just my $0.02.

	Finns had to do their best last night when they played against Norway
in world champs. After two periods the score was still 0-0. This game was 
quite much similar to the first game Finland played  (against France).
The norwegian goalie was very good and a bit lucky, too. In the third period
Juha Riihij{rvi scored 1-0 from a rebound, the time was around 5 mins or so.
The second goal was scored by Kari Harila, who shot straight from a faceoff
behind the Nowwegian goalie. Saku Koivu, the 18-year-old center got his first
point of this tournament. Saku Koivu played very well througout the game and he
was awarded the best player of the game- prize. Despite the fact that he is
quite small in size he handles the puck very well and is a fast skater. 
I think that we will hear from this guy in the future.

If my powerplay was as bad as Montreal's, I'd be thanking Stewart for calling
as few penalties as possible. Quebec's powerplay is lethal and it is to their
advantage to have a penalty-filled game where they can clean up with their
superior powerplay. 

Montreal really lost that game (and game 2) because Patrick Roy is well on
his way to having another one of his trademark awful playoffs. The man is
truly overrated. Quebec has scored six goals on Roy and four, perhaps five, 
were quite stoppable.

Hi guys....

What happened?
	1.  Potvin didn't let six goals by.
	2.  Wendel and Andreychuk woke up.
	3.  Home ice and LOTS of yelling in the Gardens gave the Leafs
		the emotional edge.
	4.  Refs calls (especially last night) tended to favour Leafs.

	A couple of comments:

	1.  On Gilmour:  Just because the guy isn't one of the three
	stars doesn't mean he was not leading the team.  Someone posted
	the playoff point total and he's in something like fifth or sixth
	place....plus, he walked away with the Molson cup (given for
	accumulating points from the three star selection) during the
	regular season.

	2.  On the officiating:  I've heard gripes from both ends on this
	one.  Emotions are very high in this series;  the rivalry is
	one of the stronger ones I know of.  I do have to agree that the
	officiating last night was pro-Leaf in general (except for whoever
	missed that slash on Gilmour's hand).

	3.  In general:  I STILL think Detroit has one of the better
	chances vs. Pittsburgh (though I think the Leafs would do better
	against the Blues....but not as well if they made it out of the
	division). Problem is, I like both these teams, though I'm
	supporting the Leafs on the underdog principle.  D

	By the way...Gilmour tiring out is a lot like Bob Probert not
		playing aggressive hockey....
	By the way....I'm not any sort of expert, nor do I claim to be.
		I just like watching a good matchup.

While I will first congratulate the Blues for their victory, I think it must
be realized that the primary reason the Blues were able to win was Curtis   
Joseph.  When a goalkeeper gets hot, there is little an opposing team can do.
Joseph should be given the entire city of St. Louis, because otherwise there 
would probably be a game 6 scheduled.  

As for the game on Sunday.  The Blues caught a few breaks, without a doubt.
One was the Referee constantly watching the Blackhawks, looking for reasons to
give them penalties.  Second, The Blues first goal resulted because the puck
hit the linesman as the Blackhawks attempted to clear.  No linesman, no shot
for Brett(I can redirect anything)Hull to redirect.  On another of St. Louis'
goals, Belfour was tripped from behind as he went to make the save by someone
who didn't belong in the crease, which means it was a St. Louis player.
Finally, the overtime goal was caused because someone kept Belfour from getting back to the crease.  No goalie, no way to stop the shot.

I congratulate St. Louis for beating the Hawks.  It will be a shame to see
Bryan Murray finally advance to the Campbell Conference Finals because Joseph
won't be able to stop the powerful Red Wing attack.

Don't give up so soon.  A lot of Burgh fans didn't give up at 3-1 last year.
You gotta believe!  (Hard as that may seem)  With the Caps with the #1 power

the Caps have to do is make sure it doesn't go OT...as that was Boston's and

There was a discussion about how real fans were ones who respect their teams
no matter ow bad they are. That's bullshit. Anyone who would follow the
Pens or the Pirates in parts of the early eighties on a devoted basis are
losers. It's OK to follow and be concerned about your home team. But
to  give them respect even when it is clear the management and the players suck
should not be required of a true fan.A  true fan would follow the team in
troubled times to the extent that they could discuss how to improve the team.

When I visit PIttsburgh, I'll refuse to go to a Pirates game since I think
the management has given PIttsburgh a team which could have been much better
even if they couldn't sign Barry Bonds. Lert's say the Pens start doing to
their own team what the Oilers have done this year and what the Whalers have
done in recent years, I would be hard pressed to show much enthusiasm for the

I think that while Chevy is not among the elite class of goalies, he is

Subject: Canucks 3-2 over Winnipeg
Organization: Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, B.C., Canada
Lines: 51

	The Jets gave the Canucks another run for their money in an almost
identical game to the first of the series but once again came up short as
Vancouver outscored Winnipeg 3-2.
	The pattern of the first game was repeated tonight, with the Canucks
scoring quickly and then going to sleep in the second period, only to stave
off a Jet comeback with opportune goals from their greater talent. The Jets
looked more dangerous in this one but it didn't make a difference in the 
numbers that counted: goals.
	Vancouver's big line produced again, with centre Cliff Ronning and
left winger Geoff Courtnall scoring in the first and in the second to 
boost the Canucks to a 2-0 lead on giveaways by the suspect Jet defence of
Bautin and Ulanov. Mental lapses by the defence and goal-scoring talent
in opportune areas made the difference in all three Canuck goals.
	However, as in the first game, the Jets worked hard to take the
game to the Canucks in the second period. The Jets dominated the second,
checking hard and penetrating the Vancouver zone without being challenged
by a Canuck team that wanted to pack it in early. 
	The hard work paid off late in the second, when Tie Domi caught
Vancouver goalie Kirk McLean by surprise with a sharp angle shot to make
the score 2-1. 
	Domi's goal gave the Jets new life as they began to take the rush
to the Canuck's collapsing defence. The Canucks were unwilling to do 
anything but let McLean take shots and clear the rebounds. The Jets were
allowed to set up and make plays.
	Both goalies made standup saves as the play picked up considerably.
McLean made three great saves in the second off a dancing Teammu Selanne
while Essensa was rocked by a Pavel Bure drive. Selanne looked dangerous
on the rush as the Jets pressed a series of attacks into the Canuck
zone. The Canucks, on the other hand, looked like they were offering four
checking lines in an effort to preserve their slim lead.
	A series of minor penalties at the end of the second period
resulted in a one man advantage for the Jets in the early third. The
Jet's Tempo Numminen drove a puck from the point through McLean's
legs and into the net to tie the game at 2-2.
	The Canuck's discordant play picked up where it left off.
This was characterized by long lead passes that either never connected
or were picked off by the Jets and individual rushes into a tight
Winnipeg defence that were never supported.
	However, as in the first and second Canuck goals, a Jet defensive
lapse (re: bonehead play) stalled the Winnipeg comeback. With the faceoff
in the Winnipeg zone, Pavel Bure was left to stand in the crease with
no Jet defender anywhere near him. Bure, who had been invisible in the
game up to that point, took a rebound and managed to roof it with a 
backhand even though he was off balance. 
	By then it was too late for the Jets to come back. Essensa made it
to the bench with one minute to go but the extra attacker did nothing
for their attack. Canucks 3, Winnipeg 2.
	Next game is Friday at Winnipeg with the Jets in the hole by two games.

Chevy has let in 2 or 3 soft goals so far, but they all didn't matter.
However, his recent history has been inconsistant play but comes up
big when it counts.  The score was 4-0 I think when the goal you mentioned
was scored.  In the third period when it looked like Toronto was coming
back, Chevy was exceptional.  I can see him as a Barraso style playoff
goalie:  inconsistant when there's nothing on the line,
but comes up big when really needed.  I guess we'll both find out.

I am not so sure about the celebrated players of the game, but Tod Hartje,
who played for Harvard in college and then went on to play in the AHL
(initially for Moncton and currently for Providence-- thanks to Daryl 
Turner for the update!) appeared on David Letterman's show about two
years ago now.

Tod has the distinction of being the first American born player to go 
and play in the former Soviet Union. This was arranged by Jets GM Mike 
Smith while Tod was playing in Moncton at about the time all those 
European players were coming over to North America to play in the NHL.

Tod spent a year playing in Russia and played with or against some of
the Russian players who have just entered the NHL in the last two years.
He wrote a book on his experiences called ""Behind the Red Line"" (check it
out!) and appeared on the Letterman show to talk about them.

It was NOT Krupp's skate.  Krupp was defending against Steve Tuttle,
of the Blues.  They both sort of tripped and fell toward Malarchuk,
and Tuttle's skate came perilously close to cutting (but actually just
missed) the jugular.  Malarchuk immediately fell to the ice, hands at
his neck, blood on the ice.

He'd been suffering from it for over a decade.  He just wasn't
diagnosed for it until he didn't sleep for ten days and decided to
have some alcohol to help him sleep.  Unfortunately, he'd just been
put on ulcer medicine a few days earlier.  It's amazing he lasted as
long as he did.  OCD sufferers stop distinguishing the line between
reality and imagination, or fail to accept that something they've
checked is OK now.  For example, an OCD sufferrer can wash his hands
over and over and still think they're dirty.  He might check the oven
ten times to be sure it's turned off.  He might see a movie about
something and automatically assume the situation is the same for his
own life.  Malarchuk has dramatically decreased the medicine he takes,
but still needs it.  He went off it this past winter and had a bad OCD
episode and I think was in the hospital for a couple days.  (He felt
it slowed his reflexes, so he tried to go without).  In any event, he
is alive and well and living in San Diego, while playing with the
Gulls (IHL).

And Tuttle is no longer with the Blues, but I don't know where he is.

That's not inner calm.  It's boredom, and it's being spoiled.  The Arena's
been as quiet as a church on many nights this year; too many of us just
take winning for granted.  It's been seemingly forever since the team
lost, and we've forgotten what it's like to feel real excitement and

The last year before Bryan Murray took over, the Wings did not make the
playoffs.  While they had been considered a possible contender when Jacques
Demers first arrived, in his last two years they were, respectively,
embarrassed in the first round by Chicago, and then failed to make the 
playoffs (at a time, a might add, when there were only five teams in the
Norris).

It's true that Vancouver did not make the playoffs for many a year before 
Quinn came, but in those years the Smythe Division was a lot--I mean *a lot*--
tougher division than the Norris, also known as the ""Snorris"", division.
Vancouver had to play Edmonton and Calgary, both very legitimate Stanley
Cup contenders, eight times a year, while Detroit got to play such 
powerhouses as Toronto and Minnesota.  Now, Edmonton is hardly even a force
in the league, and the Smythe even has the mighty San Jose sharks, while
over this same period of time in which Vancouver was improving, so was 
everybody in the Norris (except St. Louis).  Detroit had to improve just
to keep up with the competition in their division.  They had to improve *a
lot* to get better than their competition in the Norris.

Bryan Murray inherited a team with very little talent.  For really good
players, they had Yzerman, Burr, and Probert, and that was about it.  (And
no doubt some will dispute whether Burr and Probert were that good). The
rest were either very green rookies or washed up veterans.  The only reason
they got as far as they did in the years before Murray came was due to the
coaching of Demers, who, at least at first, got every last ounce of effort
possible out of his team.  Then, even his coaching began to degrade.

>So Quinn has improved his team more than Murray has since taking over as a GM.
>Quinn is one example of a better GM than Murray.

There are a number of reasons why Detroit wasn't in as bad a shape standings
wise when Murray took over as Vanc. was when Quinn took over, some of which
I outlined above, but Murray did not have any better personnel to work with
at the outset than did Quinn, with the exception of Yzerman.  And one player
cannot alone make a team into a Stanley Cup contender, as I'm sure everyone
reading this will agree.  

We'll be able to see better which team is really the most improved when they
face each other in the conference final (assuming they don't get knocked out,
like last year).

Actually, that's based on the NHL's history of 7 games.  The statstical
odds of winning one straight game -- 50/50.  Two straight games -- 25%.  Three
straight games -- 12.5%, 4 straight games = 6.25%.  The odds of the Penguins
winning 14 straight games in the playoffs was 0.0061%.  Of course, this doesn't
include weighted average, but the Pens beating the Devils 3 straight (a weaker
team) along with beating the Rangers 3 straight (a much stronger team) has made
the act balanced out.  That's about right.  For Boston the odds of winning are
probably closer to 10% (with weighted average) since Buffalo's record isn't as
good and Boston has a stronger team.  Enough about my QBA probabilities though!

Moog gets about ***'s out of 5 for his performance from me.  I give Blue 4

I think Buffalo will win in 6 -- it's not like Boston is getting blown away.

    I remember reading an article in Reader's digest many moons ago
 about a similar incident. During a minor leaque game a player neck was
 cut when the opponent he was back-checking tripped and his skakes
 flew up. In this case the victim's mask proved a hinderance since
 his face was protected and so he didn't bother with the
 usually instinctive reaction to protect his face/neck. A quick        
 thinking coach saved his life by applying direct pressure and using
 snow to contract the blood vessels (from what I can remember).

So this year you had a game on SCNY, a game on SCA, a game on ESPN,
and if the Rangers hadn't crashed and burned, you would have had a
game on MSG.  What are you complaining about?

I seem to recall last year everyone complaining about SC coverage.  I
even remember Orioles' games being shown in the DC area instead of
hockey.  And what about when SC failed to show the conclusion of other
games because its feature game was over?  Sound familiar?

This year I'm getting twice the coverage.  I can see all the Caps
games *plus* the games ESPN shows.  I think it's great that hockey is
back on ESPN.  IMHO, they're doing a great job especially considering
the baseball contract they have to work around.

Yes, he does.  BUT, the goalie sure as hell doesn't want him there!  When
I played roller hockey (boy do I miss those days) as a goalie, I would
scream at my defense to clear guys out of the slot.  I don't care if he's
in the crease or not, get him the hell away from me so I can see the ball!
(Yes, roller hockey, remember)  And if there was nobody around to clear
the slot, then I'd do it myself by pushing the offending player--*hard*. 
I *hate* people in my way when I'm the goalie, and I am sure Felix does
too.  I should say that I didn't see the incident, so if Potvin really
swung the stick big time, then that's not right, but he can move people
out of the way.  He's a player on the ice too, you know.  :-)

It is indeed nice to have fans that are concerned about the dearth of
disputatious dissertation linked to my hiatus.  Have simply been too
damned busy lately to keep you lads and lassies entertained.  You can
be sure, however, that I will somehow manage to find time to woof if 
the Leafs give just cause. 

And let's all try to keep people's names (especially mine) out of the
subject headers.  I, for one, neither seek nor enjoy such a cheap form
of notoriety.

One thing you can be assured of, however, is this: the Leafs are the
best of all the teams in the league that have allowed 12 goals in 2 
games.

He'll slam Clinton for anything at all on the air.  I just do not
understand why he remains so popular.  He'll take a piece of video of
Clinton walking along; find a frame in which Clinton wrinkles his
nose, say; freeze on it and blow it up full screen; and then rant for
five minutes on how no one could possibly trust someone with such a
face and such beady greedy little eyes.  I've seen this on his TV show
(it was around the time of the inauguration).  Can anyone call this
stuff legitimate (I hate to say ""informed"") commentary?  How can
anyone with half a brain in his or her head[1] continue to watch
it[2]?

The American TV-watching (and I guess radio-listening) public never
ceases to amaze me.

Well, isn't this just a hoot! :)  All I read on this group is a bunch
of ppl fearing the misuses of information by the big bad evil govt.
This just happens to be a case of an ordinary-joe-netter, who decided
that he would create and/or distribute some misinformation.  Ppl buy
into BS posts like this (I know, because I forwarded a copy of the
post to my office mate, who turned around and was (although he won't
admit it...sorry Joe!) ready to get in a fight about F-O-R-F-E-I-T-U-R-E!!!)
Please, if we're going to hold our govt (which admittedly has had and
still has its problems) to high standards, then mustn't we follow these
too?  Electronic Freedoms only go so far.

This article will just scratch the surface of a few security
considerations, comments are requested. (email: fw@world.std.com)
My thanks to the people who responded, both on usenet and from
Oracle Corp.

The most common response was to suggest use of oracle audit 
features or OPS$ passwords to control access (opinion on OPS$
included suggestions to use and not use). I was also advised to 
use table views to refine the granularity of access control.

One important security consideration in networked installations
is that OPS$ accounts presume that the client host provides user
authentication. Os/2 server OPS$ users are only as secure as the 
_least_ secure machine on the network. Hence you should probably 
not define any OPS$ accounts on systems with PC's, or limit access 
of OPS$ accounts to data with no security concerns. Unix oracle 
servers provide for disabling OPS$ access over the network (orasrv
option), while relying on host security for local processes. 

Internally Oracle provides powerful and well documented (sic) 
audit mechanisms which the DBA will use to monitor system and
data access. These tools can be used to track the primary security
risks from within the Oracle environment.

Oracle password security is based on a proprietary usage of DES
encryption. Oracle Corp. states that the algorithm is not prone
to cleartext attack. This is a difficult claim to substantiate 
since the algorithm is unknown. The concern here is that if users 
choose easily guessed passwords. _If_ a cracker can gain access 
to your oracle database files through the host operating system, 
s/he could extract the 'cyphertext' password data and apply 
cryptanalysis techniques to learn the users passwords.

As security risks go, the above scenario is pretty low severity.
Certainly once an intruder has access to the raw database files,
s/he can access to the data in them. If a cracker _could_ break 
the passwords, however, s/he could do substantial damage without
alerting the auditing mechanism's, and leaving and audit trail
which would point to valid users. At present Oracle (like Unix)
provides no native means of ensuring that passwords are not 
guessable. 

As with all computer security, the most important defense is to 
educate users in the safe choice of passwords. These techniques
are well discussed in internet rfc#1281 and the Crack manual, 
(both available from ftp archive servers) and, UNIX(R) System 
Security (Curry, David A. - Addison-Welsey 1992)

This analogy fails in its assumption that the government gives two

In addition, Apple's proclaimed purpose in releasing the Macintosh wasn't
survellience.

Quite the opposite:

1984 won't be, like '1984'""

We would like to keep it that way. Thats the point. By reacting
strongly and forcefully now, we will assure that we continue to remain
free. You cannot overreact to a threat like this. The worst that
happens if we overreact is that we waste time and effort. The worst that
happens if we underreact is tyranny. I prefer overreaction myself.

Doesn't that tell you how precious and hard to maintain freedom is?

Only through centuries of overreaction have we managed to maintain
ourselves in this state of even moderate freedom. I suggest that
overreacting now and in the future is a good thing.

   I've got an idea that would remove most of the political complaints
I have about the Clipper chip.  Pass a law stating that if, within a
year of performaing a wiretap on someone, a police agency hasn't
managed to convict the suspect of the crime the warrant/wiretap was for,
then that agency owes the suspect $1 million to repay him/her for
lost privacy.
   Of course, there are *still* problems with the technical aspects of
Clipper, and with the one-size-fits-all mentality that would be behind
an attempt to enforce it as a standard.  But this would be a way for
those in favor of allowing continued wiretaps to assure us that it will
only be used in cases where the crime is important and the police are
all but certain that there really will be a conviction....

brings up the issue of how the escrow agent will be paid, and the fact
that the government had financial leverage if they don't cooperate.
It's an important issue, especially if one of the escrow agents
decides they'd rather stop offering the service. 
I assume that if the escrow agent isn't the government,
then the contract for providing escrow service would include some
termination clause like returning the keys.

>   The easiest way is a user fee for each clipper chip manufactured. 
>   This makes the funding separate from government.

But who's the user paying the fees here, and what's the service?  
If the user is the government, then the funding's not separate from the government.

If the user is the buyer, what's the service?  
Keeping the key for me?  No thanks - I don't need, and won't buy their service!
Not telling everybody my key?  Sounds like blackmail!

If the user is the manufacturer, does the user have a choice about buying?
The alternative is to just generate the key and not escrow it, which is fine -
I'd certainly pay more for this kind of key than an escrowed key!

Face it, the escrow provider is providing a service the users don't want.
The only people who want it are the government, not the users.
What you're really talking about is either the government paying for
the service, up front or per-year, either from general taxes,
or from a special direct tax on wiretap chips, or on an indirect tax
(forcing the manufacturer to pay the fee to the escrow agent.)

I hope the escrow people have no way of finding out your name from
your serial number, especially if the escrow is a government agency.

Here in New Jersey, we have lots of people willing to provide that
sort of services for user fees.  There are people willing to keep your
store from burning down for a small monthly fee, though sometimes people
refuse to pay and discover that the service really was effective.
If you go to a baseball game at Yankee Stadium, there are people who
will watch your car in the parking lot for a small user fee.
Something could scratch the paint, after all.
And what a shame if your Clipper key got out!

The proposal could be modified so that if they get a court order to tap you
and don't charge you with a crime within, say, 90 days, they have to buy you
a new phone.

If they do charge you, and you are found innocent, they have to buy you a

Khufu and Khafre are both patented (#5003597).  Biham and Shamir showed
that differential cryptanalysis can break 16-round Khafre with a chosen-
plaintext attack using 1500 different encryptions.  Khafre with 24 rounds
can be broken with the same attack using 2^53 different encryptions.
(There are probably more efficient differential cryptanalytic attacks, if
someone wants to take the time to look.)

Khufu has key-dependent S-boxes, and is immune to differential cryptanalysis.
Source code for this algorithm (and Khafre) are in the patent.

Snefru is a public-domain one-way hash function.  The version of Snefru
that produces a 128-bit hash is vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis
(vulnerable means that the attack is more efficient that brute force) for
four passes or less.  Given that, SHA and MD5 are much more efficient.

Oh yes, anyone interested in licensing the patent should contact Dave Petre,
Director of Patent Licencing for Xerox, (203) 986-3231.

That wasn't my point. My point is that your implied position about the ""Waco
Massacre"" is an assertion cum political position. According to a CNN poll,
about 86% of Americans think the FBI acted properly, and a majority think
they should have done it (the tear gas) a lot sooner. A large majority also
believe the FBI was not at all responsible for the death of the victims,
Koresh was. (Let's avoid the kind of fruitless argument of the sort If A
hadn't X'd, then B might not have Y'd....)

What you call the ""Big Brother Chip"" is right now a proposal under
discussion, and it is not yet clear that strong crypto is going to be
banned.

Therefore neither justifies ""any tactic is fair."" Thus the statement is
nonsense. It is pernicious, because ""any tactic"" can lead to damaging
others.

As I see you know from the tone of your reply, there's nothing personal
intended.

I thought you all might like to see this. It's a letter from Jerry
Berman to David Chaum from November of 1985, in response to
information that Mr. Chaum sent to Mr. Berman.

While I have to congratulate EFF for its prompt response to the
Clipper Chip announcement from the White House, I think it's important
to recognize the philosophy of their Executive Director, as explained
below.

I agree that legal remedies are important, but when pressed, I'd
prefer to retain the ability to use purely technical solutions to
preserve my privacy, because they'll hold up under fire.

Mr. Chaum has consented to the publication of this letter on the Net. 

I don't work for, nor am I a member of EFF, ACLU, or any similar
organizations, but I do agree with them on a great many things.

	Thank you for sending me a most interesting article.   A
society of  individuals  and  organizations  that  would  expend  the
time and resources to use a  series  of  'digital  pseudonyms' to
avoid data linkage does not in my opinion make big brother
obsolete but  acts  on  the  assumption  that  big  brother  is  ever
present.  I  view  your  system  as  a  form  of  societal  paranoia.

	As a matter of  principle,  we  are  working  to  enact  formal
legal protections for  individual  privacy  rather  than  relying  on
technical solutions.   We want to  assume  a  society  of  law  which
respects legal limits rather than  a  society  that  will  disobey  the
law, requiring  citizens  to  depend  on  technical  solutions.  e.g.
require  a  judical  warrant  for  government  interception  of  data
communications rather than  encrypt  all  messages  on  the  assumption
that regardless of the lawt  the  government  will  abuse  its  power
and invade privacy.

	As a  matter  of  practicality,  I  do  not  think  your  system
offers much hope for privacy.    First, the trend toward universal
identifiers  is  as  much.-a  movement  generated  by  government  or
industry's desire to keep track of all citizens as it is by
citizens seeking simplicity and convenience in all transactions.
At best,  your  system  would  benefit  the  sophisticated  and  most
would opt for  simplicity.  The  poor  and  the  undereducated  would
never use or benefit from it.

	Finally where there's a  will, there's  a  way. If  government
wants to link data bases, it  will,  by  law, require  the  disclosure
of various individual pseudonyms used by citizens or prohibit it
for data bases which the government wants to link.      Since
corporations  make  money  by  trading  commercial  lists  with   one
another, they will never adopt  the  system  or  if  it  is  adopted,
will use ""fine printn  contracts  to  permit  selling  various   codes
used by their customers to other firms.

	The solution remains law, policy, and consensus about limits
on government or corporate intrusion into areas of individual
autonomy.  Technique can be used to enforce that consensus or to
override it. It cannot be used as a substitute for such
consensus.



                                            Sincerely Yours,

I posted an informational request about any electronically available
articles on cryptographic algorithms a couple of days ago.  As I
mentioned, I was interested, in particular, in DES and Public-Key --
but also wouldn't mind learning about others.  As I said, I can read
an intro-graduate level text book, having had some mathematics, though
not much number-theory per se.  I'd like to see the technical details
of the mathematics of cryptography, as oppossed to the popularizations
of things like _scientific am_ which just say, ""then you find a
*really* big prime number...."".

Following my request, several people were so kind as to suggest
reading-lists, which I hope to get around to.  Two other people were
so *very* kind as to send large documents, which I presume were actual
articles (about 1000 lines each); but I've stupidly deleted them
accidentally before having a chance even to skim them.  If they can
forgive me for my careless use of file-commands, would the original
senders be so kind as to resend? Or anyone else who has good
crypto-articles at a fairly technical mathematical level? Also,
ftp-able or gopher-able docs would be nice to know about.

Yours, Lulu...

This has to be a dictionary attack.  No other attack makes sense.


This means that whoever encrypted the file just typed some password
which was a single dictionary word, and then Russell tried all the
words in the dictionary.  This isn't too implausible, especially if he
was smart and clipped the first plaintext block off the ciphertext (if
the first block doesn't decrypt then obviously the others won't
either).

Assuming one attempt a second, it takes seven hours to try all the
words in /usr/dict/words.   Not real tough.

If you want DES to be secure, you have to use RANDOM KEYS.  You can't
just type your wife's name and think ""aha they'll never guess that
one!""

Then it was either _really_ good luck or you had some _very_ fast
machine.  DES has 2^56 possible keys, each two of which are simply
to convert into each other, so you have to expect 2^54 trial encryptions
in the mean case, assuming known plaintext.
2^54 / 2 / (24*60*60) / 1000000 is ca. 104250.
So you must have managed to do 104250 encryptions per microsecond.
CE Infosys builds a very fast DES chip that manages 2 (!) encryptions
per microsecond.

Yes, I'm not very seriously bothered about the security of DES yet;
though you might prefer to use triple DES or IDEA, both of which
use more key bits.

As one of the people who convinced Jerry that legal protections for privacy
are insufficient, and that technical measures, especially public key
cryptography, are also vitally necessary, I can tell you that Jerry and EFF
are fully committed to this position.

The previous poster is apparently unaware of a long series of EFF positions in
support of this view.  I suggest those interested read EFF's position on
Clipper or our other work in digital privacy.  Check ftp.eff.org for more
details.

One of the great things about human beings is that they are capable of change
and evolution in their thinking.  The idea that crypto is critical to privacy
is one which is no longer limited to certain net afficianados, but is 
spreading to parts of the public policy community in Washington.

The Shannon limit for voice lines is likely somewhere around 25kbps.
We are rapidly approaching it. The fastest affordable full-duplex

>How far can voice be compressed?

CELP manages to sound decent at 4800 bps.

In theory, if you built a speech recognition system that turned voice
into ASCII, and a perfect synthesis system on the other end that
sounded just like the person you were speaking to, you could get it
down to the information content of the speech.

With various kinds of LPC, you can get it down to 2400 bps or prehaps
even less, at which point it sounds horrible.

4800 bps is more than adequite for our purposes.

David,

   Neither (1) or (2) apply with the government, though. The feds, unlike
Apple, have repeatedly demonstrated that trust is an unsafe thread on which
to hang your freedom. Why?  Because unlike Apple in (2), the govt has no
credibility to lose. I'm serious about this. One can name just about any
agency -- the IRS, RTC, FCC, FAA, FBI, NSA, CIA -- and find numerous examples
of the public trust run roughshod over. Worse, one can rarely find in such 
examples any serious consequences to the offending agency. Even supposing
we could get a reign on trust somehow, there's always the matter of competence
in govt agencies. Can they even trust themselves?

  -mel

  P.S. I was amused when you mentioned the USDA as an example of an agency
capable of managing the an escrow. I'm a consultant to the USDA, and while those
*I* work with are wonderful <grin>, the agency itself is ranked in industry
publications such as Govt Computer News as one of the worst caretakers of
its computer resources. Recently, Prime Time Live did a long segment on
the USDA's computer troubles. They are making a concerted effort to change,
but intentions don't make a track record.

No no no no no no no.

It will go like this:

FEDS: We need the key to phone 334RE67D99.

ESCROW: You have a warrant to tap the line phone 334RE67D99 is on?

FEDS: Yes.

ESCROW: Fine, here is our key.

What happens is, Feds tap a line; find Clipper is being used; extract
serial number; get key; decipher convo.  The serial number is never
registered to a specific owner, it is _sent_ as part of the
conversation.  If I give you my Clipper phone, you do not need to
re-register it (mainly because it was never 'registered' to me in the
first place).

There are a lot of things that bother me about Clipper, but this is
not one of them.  Let's get our facts straight and not waste effort

Well, lets for a hypothetical put our selves in the place of the US end
of the drug rings. What do we do about the Cripple chip? First off, we
would express disaproval to our congress critters, and remind them of the
large sums of money our legitimate co.s provide to their campain coffers. We
would also let them know via the 'other' channels that a) their income is about
to take a hit, and b) their health may not be too good either.

But just in case, the next obvious step to take is to BUY Mycotoxic and VLSI!
Yeah, free enterprise at work. :-) Now they have the Cripple in their pockets,
literaly as well as figurativly. Tough about the masses though.

This is an interesting point.  As a VERY COARSE rule of thumb, you can
figure that the final price of a product is 3 to 5 times the Cost Of Goods.
(The exact multiplier depends largely on economies of scale: Products that
sell tens of millions of units/year will be at the low end, those that sell
thousands of units/year will be at the high end.  I suspect cellular phones
are in the middle).  This implies that adding a $25 chip would increase the
cost of the phone by approx $100, or about 25% - 30%.

I don't think you'll get a lot of consumer support for this.

The following program is a very quick hack I created a few months
ago to determine whether a Sun Sparcstation IPC could perform
real-time, full-duplex encrypted audio with resulting data rates
sustainable by today's modems.

This test program reads linearly-encoded audio from the audio device,
compresses it with GSM 06.10 (compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples
recorded at 8kHz into 260 bits resulting in a 50 Hz frame rate), encrypts
it with DES, then reverses the process and sends the reconstructed audio
back to the audio device.  The compressed, encrypted audio stream
is 13 kbits/s (!).

My Sparcstation IPC (not exactly a very fast machine these days,
certainly slower than an ELC) would just barely sustain this activity
(audio underruns would occcur but the speech was very intelligible).  I
ran it as a real-time process to get the best results.  Remember,
though, that this program is a quick hack and the performance can
certainly be improved.

The audio compression routines can be ftp'd from tub.cs.tu-berlin.de,
I believe (look for gsm or toast).  I used Eric Young's DES
implementation but I no longer know where I got it from.

     Why don't we move down even further toward the masses by setting this
up on an IBM PC clone(probably needs to be a 386 or a 486) with a 
sound blaster and a V.32bis modem.  Those components are very widely
available.  I don't know if the PC has enough horsepower to encrypt the data
at realtime, but the sound blaster has 4 to 1 hardware compression and will
work at any sampling rate from 4KHz to 23 KHz.

What is wrong with the clipper chip - By usenet users
-----------------------------------------------------

1) It is secret. 
2) How can we trust the escrow agencies?
3) It is not cost-effective
4) We want other encryption systems, the government seems to want to
   disallow it in the future
5) Anyone can build a non-key system
6) We are worried about a back door
7) Once everyone uses a clipper chip, the mechanism for a Big-Brother
   government is in place, a change of government can lead to it. 
   Especially since the escrow agencies operation is not governed by
   law (so the president can change the rules to allow free access to
   the keys at any time, e.g., during war)
8) Few criminals are caught by wiretaps, the cost [and risks] are unjustified

The serial number will be in a 64 bit block, with a 34 bit filler.  Doesn't

I was under the impression (from reading Denning's description of the
Clipper's operation) that the same session key *is* used in both directions for
encrypting the message text, but that each chip uses it's own key for
encrypting the session key into the law-enforcement field.  So, you only
need to know the U key for one of the phones involved to decrypt the
messages in both directions.

Is this ""White House e-mail address"" really working yet? Someone
posted such an address on CompuServe a few months ago, but apparently
the White House wasn't really set up to recive hundreds (thousands?)
of messages a day to that account and didn't want people to use it
yet. So is this MCI address something the people at the White House
actually read, or is it another Craig Shergold story? I don't know --
I'm just asking.

Unless the people at the White House print and distribute this mail
every day, you may have better luck printing out a letter (on paper,
that flat white stuff all over my desk) and Snail-Mailing it to the
White House. I imagine writing to your local representative and
senator wouldn't hurt either. Heck, why not write to Al Gore while
you're at it?

I don't believe you, and I don't believe your friend.

Why? 

Because DES is not known to have any known plaintext attacks readily
availble. Unless your friend knows something and is keeping it secret,
he was bullshitting you.

Now, it IS possible that he noted a weakness in the *implementation* of
the Kerberos protocol. For instance, using a weak RNG to generate keys
might cut down on the keyspace (not for the user keys -- for the other
kind who's name I can't remember). However, this is not what was
claimed. You are claiming a general weakness in DES, which is not
known to exist in the open literature.

Don't get me wrong -- DES is weaker than it should be. However,
cracking it in 15 minutes requires more money be spent on the cracking
machine than ANY organization I know of has available.

From the US law perspective, unless you're engaging in illegal speech,
it's not illegal to use encryption.  Yet.  The NSA is allowed to try
to listen, but you're not obligated to make it easy for them.  Yet.
The other country may have more repressive laws about that;
I gather France's bureaucracy wants to know what you're saying, 
and in the old Soviet Union, they didn't need laws to make things illegal :-(

(paranoia follows, for those of you who want to play it safe :-)
The fact that the NSA is listening may affect your willingness to use
wimpy crypto technologies, but it may also affect your willingness to
use technologies that violate RSA's patents, e.g. if you use PGP, the
NSA may tell RSA that you're doing so, and if the Secret Service catches on,
they may decide that the mere fact that RSA hasn't filed a lawsuit
against you doesn't mean that you don't deserve to have your computer

   I heard somewhere (can't name the source) that TEMPEST does not necessarily
   pick-up just CRTs, but it can pick up emissions from almost any chip.  If
   that is true, the kind monitor would not make any difference becuase everything
   on the screen can be picked-up from the video controller.  Can anybody verify
   or refute this?

Yes, that's true.  TEMPEST is nothing magic, it's just listening to any
available electromagnetic emissions and using all the analysis techniques  
you know to separate out the interesting stuff. 

The nice thing about old CRTs is that they used to put out LOTS of
signal, so they're easy to detect, and if you do your sync carefully,
you can watch the output on the monitor in your deceptively-marked
Chevy Step-Van.  Some brands of electric typewriters were even worse.
In both cases, it's especially nice because it gets you the data the
user is looking at, rather than whatever stuff the paging algorithm is
paging out to disk, etc.

With newer, quieter equipment, there isn't as much signal, and it's harder to
isolate the fun parts.  TEMPEST-rated equipment has much lower signal levels.
But ""Everything has vibrations"", as Master Chuan said.

        Only guessing, but from his address I'd say that Jerry, like
        me, lives in Canada. Unlike me, he thinks that our friends in
        the US enjoy the same freedom that we do, and he has not seen
        the slow but steady erosion to the south of us.

        We have the benefit of relatively slow politicians and
        ineffective law enforcement. Our rednecks tend to be the
        objects of derision rather than elected officials. It's
        everything LE can do to keep up with the real criminals. Any
        time they actually go after somebody just because they don't
        like his or her attitude, it's national news (It also often
        blows up in their faces: eg. the well-intentioned but flawed
        Zundel case, which resulted in a scolding from the Supreme
        Court, not only to LE for prosecuting the case but to
        Parliament for passing the law it was prosecuted under).

        Our friends south of the border don't have as easy a time of
        it. Among other things they have as many LE agencies as we
        have agencies, and some of them have teeth. They also have the
        War on Drugs which gives law-enforcement agencies exceptional
        powers to ignore individuals' rights (the DEA has more
        arbitrary power than that given to Canadian agencies under the
        War Measures Act). We have the RCMP and CSIS who can't stop
        fighting each other long enough to do any really effective
        suppression of private citizens' rights. Not only that, our
        Police Commissions have teeth, as I learned when I had to fend
        off a bent cop.

        It may be ironic that the nation founded on Life, Liberty and
        the Pursuit of Happiness is getting government-imposed order,
        while the nation founded on Peace, Order and Good Government
        is getting in-your-face liberty.

        That's not to say our time won't come. It looks like Chretien
        is going to run on a law-and-order platform. Be afraid.

Subject: Basic Crypto Requirements
Organization: Express Access Online Communications, Greenbelt, MD USA

  In order to have formulate a rational position on what cryptography
policies are acceptable, we must set forth a list of basic requirements.
I would propose the following as a starting point:

  1. The algorithm must be publicly known, and must have a record of
       surviving attempts by outside experts to find weaknesses.

  2. The system implementation must make it possible to verify that the
       advertised algorithm is, in fact, the one that is being used.

  3. The key must be quickly changeable by the user, and must be of a
       sufficient length and complexity to defeat any brute-force search
       possible now or in the reasonably near future.

  Note that these requirements are not incompatible with some form of key
escrow system; the May 1993 issue of ""Byte"" describes an example of an
encryption system which can clearly be implemented in a manner consistent
with the above requirements while requiring that parts of the key be
escrowed in order to have one's public key listed by a central distributor.

Maybe so, but it's quite common. There are millions of Macintosh users who
have no idea what's in Apple's patented ROMs. Many have modems connected.
How do you know all your business secrets aren't being stolen? Answer:
1. Because you trust Apple;
2. Because if any such attempt, however sophicsticated, came out, it would
destroy Apple's credibility forever.

In the Clipper case, a representative body of experts is going to be allowed
to audit it, and we'll have assurances (maybe even from the President) that
other than the escrowed keys there are no back doors. While some may not
have confidence in that (I am not among them), it's a lot more assurance
than we get for many things we routinely trust in everyday life.

Thanks. Got that from two other sources as well. The full quote is as
follows:

From Dorothy Denning, CRYPTOGRAPHY AND DATA SECURITY, Addison-Wesley
1982,1983, page 8:

""Cryptosystems must satisfy three general requirements:

""2. The system must be easy to use.

""3. The security of the system should depend only on the secrecy of the

   Actually, David, I don't think it's any more intellectually honest to
say there are no backdoors than to say there are backdoors, unless you've
had a chance to examine the algorithm and the silicon closely.  For all
we know, skipjack could be easily broken, or impossible to break.  And
clearly, if skipjack is not secure, then the clipper chip is not worth much.

I have been looking over the postings about the Clipper Chip and noticed
an interesting omission from the discussion.

You all mention that the algorithm is classified and have expressed 
concerns and ideas of how to figure out the algorithm using software.

The question that I have is why cant someone take one of these chips
and reverse engineer it? I mean, take the thing to a chip testing/
analysis facility, one with a decent electron microscope. Just pry
off the top of the chip and start scanning it with the electron
microcope and figure out the circuitry. I remembered a place that I use
to work for had one of these facilities that they used to analyze chips
that we accidently blew out while running tests. They could actually find
the area that was fried and show us where in the circuit it was. 

I am sure that many companies and universities must have these facilities
and that the potential is there, especially at a university where the
security at such a facility is looser, for someone to take a clipper
apart and analyze it?

What can the government do to prevent this? Start taking away all 
microchip analysis facilities and electron microscopes??

Dear Senator/Congressman/President {fill in the blank}

I am writing you to voice my strong opposition to President Clinton's Clipper 
Chip initiative. This proposal to establish a secret government designed
cryptography chip with government key registration as the standard for voice
encryption is very disturbing. The idea that citizens must register their 
secrets with the government just in case they are trying to keep them secret 
is patently unAmerican. Additionally, the press release for this program
strongly implied that other forms of cryptography would be banned after the 
Clipper Chip standard is in place. This latest attack on our civil rights is 
deeply disturbing and is frankly a voting issue for me. 

The presidents press release stated that the plan strikes a balance between the
legitimate needs of law enforcement and a citizens right to privacy but this 
is not the case. The fact is that since other strong cryptographic equipment 
is avalible the criminals, drug dealers and terrorists mentioned in the press 
release will simply use non clipper cryptography. Meanwhile the average citizen
may gain no protection against warentless wiretaps by the government since the 
government escrowed key is derived deterministicly from the unit serial number
which is broadcast by the chip durring its opperation. This seems like an 
obvious back door for the NSA and law enforcement. If you still do nott 
understand my objection to key registration, consider the way J. Edgar Hoover 
blackmailed government officials like yourself; would you now use a phone to 
transmit personal details of your life that the NSA and FBI have the keys to?

  FROM CROSSBOWS TO CRYPTOGRAPHY:  THWARTING THE STATE VIA
                     TECHNOLOGY

  Given at the Future of Freedom Conference, November 1987


     You   know,   technology--and   particularly   computer
technology--has often gotten a bad rap in  Libertarian  cir-
cles.  We tend to think of Orwell's 1984, or Terry Gilliam's
Brazil,  or  the  proximity  detectors keeping East Berlin's
slave/citizens on their own side of the border, or  the  so-
phisticated  bugging  devices  Nixon used to harass those on
his ""enemies list.""  Or, we recognize that for the price  of
a  ticket  on  the Concorde we can fly at twice the speed of
sound, but only if we first walk thru a magnetometer run  by
a  government  policeman, and permit him to paw thru our be-
longings if it beeps.

     But I think that mind-set is a mistake.   Before  there
were cattle prods, governments tortured their prisoners with
clubs  and  rubber  hoses.    Before  there  were lasers for
eavesdropping, governments used binoculars and  lip-readers.
Though  government certainly uses technology to oppress, the
evil lies not in the tools but in the wielder of the tools.

     In fact, technology represents one of the most  promis-
ing  avenues  available  for  re-capturing our freedoms from
those who have stolen them.  By its very nature,  it  favors
the  bright  (who can put it to use) over the dull (who can-
not).  It favors the adaptable (who are  quick  to  see  the
merit  of  the  new  (over  the sluggish (who cling to time-
tested ways).  And what two better words are  there  to  de-
scribe government bureaucracy than ""dull"" and ""sluggish""?

     One  of  the  clearest,  classic triumphs of technology
over tyranny I see is  the  invention  of  the  man-portable
crossbow.   With it, an untrained peasant could now reliably
and lethally engage a target out to  fifty  meters--even  if
that  target  were  a mounted, chain-mailed knight.  (Unlike
the longbow, which, admittedly was more powerful, and  could
get  off  more shots per unit time, the crossbow required no
formal training to utilize.   Whereas the  longbow  required
elaborate  visual,  tactile  and kinesthetic coordination to
achieve any degree of accuracy, the wielder  of  a  crossbow
could simply put the weapon to his shoulder, sight along the
arrow  itself, and be reasonably assured of hitting his tar-
get.)

     Moreover, since just about  the  only  mounted  knights
likely  to  visit  your  average peasant would be government
soldiers and tax collectors, the utility of the  device  was
plain:    With it, the common rabble could defend themselves
not only against one another, but against their governmental
masters.   It was the  medieval  equivalent  of  the  armor-
piercing  bullet,  and, consequently, kings and priests (the
medieval equivalent of a  Bureau  of  Alcohol,  Tobacco  and
Crossbows)  threatened  death  and  excommunication, respec-
tively, for its unlawful possession.

     Looking at later developments, we  see  how  technology
like  the  firearm--particularly the repeating rifle and the
handgun, later followed by the Gatling gun and more advanced
machine guns--radically altered the balance of interpersonal
and inter-group power.  Not without reason was the Colt  .45
called ""the equalizer.""  A frail dance-hall hostess with one
in  her  possession  was  now  fully able to protect herself
against the brawniest roughneck in any saloon.    Advertise-
ments  for  the period also reflect the merchandising of the
repeating cartridge  rifle  by  declaring  that  ""a  man  on
horseback,  armed with one of these rifles, simply cannot be
captured.""  And, as long as his captors  were  relying  upon
flintlocks  or  single-shot rifles, the quote is doubtless a
true one.

     Updating now to  the  present,  the  public-key  cipher
(with  a  personal  computer to run it) represents an equiv-
alent quantum leap--in a defensive weapon.    Not  only  can
such  a technique be used to protect sensitive data in one's
own possession, but it can also permit two strangers to  ex-
change   information   over   an   insecure   communications
channel--a  wiretapped   phone   line,   for   example,   or
skywriting, for that matter)--without ever having previously
met  to  exchange cipher keys.   With a thousand-dollar com-
puter, you can create a cipher that  a  multi-megabuck  CRAY
X-MP  can't  crack in a year.  Within a few years, it should
be economically feasible to similarly encrypt voice communi-
cations; soon after that, full-color digitized video images.
Technology will not only have made wiretapping obsolete,  it
will  have  totally demolished government's control over in-
formation transfer.

     I'd like to take just a moment to sketch the  mathemat-
ics  which makes this principle possible.  This algorithm is
called the RSA algorithm, after Rivest, Shamir, and  Adleman
who  jointly created it.  Its security derives from the fact
that, if a very large number is  the  product  of  two  very
large  primes,  then it is extremely difficult to obtain the
two prime factors from analysis  of  their  product.    ""Ex-
tremely""  in  the  sense that if primes  p  and  q  have 100
digits apiece, then their 200-digit product cannot  in  gen-
eral be factored in less than 100 years by the most powerful
computer now in existence.

     The  ""public"" part of the key consists of (1) the prod-
uct  pq  of the two large primes p and q, and (2)  one  fac-
tor,  call it  x  , of the product  xy  where  xy = {(p-1) *
(q-1) + 1}.  The ""private"" part of the key consists  of  the
other factor  y.

     Each  block of the text to be encrypted is first turned
into an integer--either by using ASCII,  or  even  a  simple
A=01,  B=02,  C=03, ... , Z=26 representation.  This integer
is then raised to the power  x (modulo pq) and the resulting
integer is then sent as the encrypted message.  The receiver
decrypts by taking this integer to the  (secret)  power    y
(modulo  pq).  It can be shown that this process will always
yield the original number started with.

     What makes this a groundbreaking development,  and  why
it  is  called  ""public-key""  cryptography,""  is  that I can
openly publish the product  pq and the number   x   ,  while
keeping  secret  the number  y  --so that anyone can send me
an encrypted message, namely
                       x
                     a    (mod pq)  ,
but only I can recover the original message  a  , by  taking
what  they  send, raising it to the power  y  and taking the
result (mod pq).  The risky step (meeting to exchange cipher
keys) has been eliminated.  So people who may not even trust
each other enough to want to meet, may  still  reliably  ex-
change  encrypted  messages--each  party having selected and
disseminated his own  pq  and his  x  ,   while  maintaining
the secrecy of his own  y.

     Another benefit of this scheme is the notion of a ""dig-
ital signature,"" to enable one to authenticate the source of
a given message.  Normally, if I want to send you a message,
I raise my plaintext  a  to your x and take the result  (mod
your pq)  and send that.

    However,  if in my message, I take the plaintext  a and
raise it to my (secret) power  y  , take the result  (mod my
pq), then raise that result to your x   (mod  your  pq)  and
send this, then even after you have normally ""decrypted"" the
message,  it  will still look like garbage.  However, if you
then raise it to my public power x   , and take  the  result
(mod  my public pq  ), so you will not only recover the ori-
ginal plaintext message, but you will know that no one but I
could have sent it to you (since no one else knows my secret
y).

     And these are the very concerns by the way that are to-
day tormenting the Soviet Union about the whole question  of
personal  computers.    On the one hand, they recognize that
American schoolchildren are right now growing up  with  com-
puters  as commonplace as sliderules used to be--more so, in
fact, because there are things computers can do  which  will
interest  (and instruct) 3- and 4-year-olds.  And it is pre-
cisely these students who one generation hence will be going
head-to-head against their Soviet  counterparts.    For  the
Soviets  to  hold  back might be a suicidal as continuing to
teach swordsmanship  while  your  adversaries  are  learning
ballistics.    On  the  other hand, whatever else a personal
computer may be, it is also an exquisitely efficient copying
machine--a floppy disk will hold upwards of 50,000 words  of
text,  and  can  be  copied in a couple of minutes.  If this
weren't threatening enough, the computer that  performs  the
copy  can also encrypt the data in a fashion that is all but
unbreakable.  Remember that in Soviet society  publicly  ac-
cessible  Xerox  machines are unknown.   (The relatively few
copying machines in existence  are  controlled  more  inten-
sively than machine guns are in the United States.)

     Now  the  ""conservative"" position is that we should not
sell these computers to the Soviets, because they could  use
them  in weapons systems.  The ""liberal"" position is that we
should sell them, in  the  interests  of  mutual  trade  and
cooperation--and  anyway,  if  we don't make the sale, there
will certainly be some other nation willing to.

     For my part, I'm ready to suggest that the  Libertarian
position should be to give them to the Soviets for free, and
if  necessary, make them take them . . . and if that doesn't
work load up an SR-71  Blackbird  and  air  drop  them  over
Moscow in the middle of the night.  Paid for by private sub-
scription, of course, not taxation . . . I confess that this
is not a position that has gained much support among members
of  the conventional left-right political spectrum, but, af-
ter all, in the words of one of Illuminatus's characters, we
are political non-Euclideans:   The shortest distance  to  a
particular  goal may not look anything like what most people
would consider a ""straight line.""    Taking  a  long  enough
world-view,  it is arguable that breaking the Soviet govern-
ment monopoly on information transfer could better  lead  to
the enfeeblement and, indeed, to the ultimate dissolution of
the Soviet empire than would the production of another dozen
missiles aimed at Moscow.

     But  there's  the rub:  A ""long enough"" world view does
suggest that the evil, the oppressive, the coercive and  the
simply  stupid  will ""get what they deserve,"" but what's not
immediately clear is how the rest of  us  can  escape  being
killed, enslaved, or pauperized in the process.

    When  the  liberals and other collectivists began to at-
tack freedom, they possessed a reasonably  stable,  healthy,
functioning economy, and almost unlimited time to proceed to
hamstring   and   dismantle  it.    A  policy  of  political
gradualism was at least  conceivable.    But  now,  we  have
patchwork  crazy-quilt  economy held together by baling wire
and spit.  The state not only taxes us to  ""feed  the  poor""
while also inducing farmers to slaughter milk cows and drive
up food prices--it then simultaneously turns around and sub-
sidizes research into agricultural chemicals designed to in-
crease  yields of milk from the cows left alive.  Or witness
the fact that a decline in the price of oil is considered as
potentially frightening as a comparable increase a few years
ago.  When the price went up,  we  were  told,  the  economy
risked  collapse for for want of energy.  The price increase
was called the ""moral equivalent of war"" and the Feds  swung
into  action.    For the first time in American history, the
speed at which you drive your car to work in the morning be-
came an issue of Federal concern.   Now, when the  price  of
oil  drops, again we risk problems, this time because Ameri-
can oil companies and Third World  basket-case  nations  who
sell  oil  may  not  be  able to ever pay their debts to our
grossly over-extended banks.  The suggested panacea is  that
government  should now re-raise the oil prices that OPEC has
lowered, via a new oil tax.  Since the government is seeking
to raise oil prices to about the same extent  as  OPEC  did,
what  can we call this except the ""moral equivalent of civil
war--the government against its own people?""

     And, classically, in international trade, can you imag-
ine any entity in the world except  a  government  going  to
court  claiming  that  a  vendor  was  selling  it goods too
cheaply and demanding not only that that naughty  vendor  be
compelled by the court to raise its prices, but also that it
be punished for the act of lowering them in the first place?

     So  while the statists could afford to take a couple of
hundred years to trash our  economy  and  our  liberties--we
certainly  cannot  count  on  having an equivalent period of
stability in which to reclaim them.   I contend  that  there
exists  almost  a  ""black  hole""  effect in the evolution of
nation-states just as in the evolution of stars.  Once free-
dom contracts beyond a certain  minimum  extent,  the  state
warps  the fabric of the political continuum about itself to
the degree that subsequent re-emergence of  freedom  becomes
all but impossible.  A good illustration of this can be seen
in the area of so-called ""welfare"" payments.  When those who
sup  at the public trough outnumber (and thus outvote) those
whose taxes must replenish the trough,  then  what  possible
choice has a democracy but to perpetuate and expand the tak-
ing  from  the few for the unearned benefit of the many?  Go
down to the nearest ""welfare"" office, find just  two  people
on  the dole . . . and recognize that between them they form
a voting bloc that can forever outvote you on  the  question
of who owns your life--and the fruits of your life's labor.

     So essentially those who love liberty need an ""edge"" of
some  sort  if  we're ultimately going to prevail.  We obvi-
ously  can't  use  the  altruists'  ""other-directedness""  of
""work,  slave, suffer, sacrifice, so that next generation of
a billion random strangers can  live  in  a  better  world.""
Recognize  that, however immoral such an appeal might be, it
is nonetheless an extremely powerful one in today's culture.
If you can convince  people  to  work  energetically  for  a
""cause,"" caring only enough for their personal welfare so as
to  remain  alive  enough  and  healthy  enough  to continue
working--then you have a truly massive reservoir  of  energy
to draw from.  Equally clearly, this is just the sort of ap-
peal which tautologically cannot be utilized for egoistic or
libertarian goals.  If I were to stand up before you tonight
and say something like, ""Listen, follow me as I enunciate my
noble ""cause,"" contribute your money to support the ""cause,""
give  up  your  free  time  to  work for the ""cause,"" strive
selflessly to bring it about, and then (after you  and  your
children are dead) maybe your children's children will actu-
ally  live under egoism""--you'd all think I'd gone mad.  And
of course you'd be right.  Because the point I'm  trying  to
make is that libertarianism and/or egoism will be spread if,
when, and as, individual libertarians and/or egoists find it
profitable and/or enjoyable to do so.    And  probably  only
then.

     While I certainly do not disparage the concept of poli-
tical  action, I don't believe that it is the only, nor even
necessarily the most cost-effective path  toward  increasing
freedom  in  our time.  Consider that, for a fraction of the
investment in time, money and effort I might expend in  try-
ing  to  convince  the  state to abolish wiretapping and all
forms of censorship--I can teach every libertarian who's in-
terested  how  to   use   cryptography   to   abolish   them
unilaterally.

     There  is  a  maxim--a proverb--generally attributed to
the Eskimoes, which very likely most Libertarians  have  al-
ready  heard.    And while you likely would not quarrel with
the saying, you might well feel that you've heard  it  often
enough already, and that it has nothing further to teach us,
and moreover, that maybe you're even tired of hearing it.  I
shall therefore repeat it now:

     If you give a man a fish, the saying runs, you feed him
for a day.  But if you teach a man how to fish, you feed him
for a lifetime.

     Your exposure to the quote was probably in some sort of
a  ""workfare""  vs.  ""welfare""  context;  namely, that if you
genuinely wish to help someone in need, you should teach him
how to earn his sustenance, not simply how to  beg  for  it.
And of course this is true, if only because the next time he
is hungry, there might not be anybody around willing or even
able to give him a fish, whereas with the information on how
to fish, he is completely self sufficient.

     But  I  submit  that this exhausts only the first order
content of the quote, and if there were nothing  further  to
glean  from  it,  I would have wasted your time by citing it
again.  After all, it seems to have almost a crypto-altruist
slant, as though to imply that we should structure  our  ac-
tivities  so  as  to  maximize  the  benefits to such hungry
beggars as we may encounter.

     But consider:

     Suppose this Eskimo doesn't know how to  fish,  but  he
does  know  how  to hunt walruses.   You, on the other hand,
have often gone hungry while traveling thru  walrus  country
because  you  had  no idea how to catch the damn things, and
they ate most of the fish you could catch.  And now  suppose
the  two  of  you  decide to exchange information, bartering
fishing knowledge for hunting knowledge.   Well,  the  first
thing  to  observe  is  that  a  transaction  of  this  type
categorically and unambiguously refutes the Marxist  premise
that  every  trade  must  have a ""winner"" and a ""loser;"" the
idea that if one person gains, it must necessarily be at the
""expense"" of another person who loses.  Clearly, under  this
scenario, such is not the case.  Each party has gained some-
thing  he  did  not have before, and neither has been dimin-
ished in any way.  When it comes to exchange of  information
(rather  than material objects) life is no longer a zero-sum
game.  This is an extremely powerful notion.   The  ""law  of
diminishing   returns,""   the  ""first  and  second  laws  of
thermodynamics""--all those ""laws"" which constrain our possi-
bilities in other contexts--no longer bind us!   Now  that's
anarchy!

     Or  consider  another possibility:  Suppose this hungry
Eskimo never learned  to  fish  because  the  ruler  of  his
nation-state    had  decreed fishing illegal.   Because fish
contain dangerous tiny bones, and sometimes sharp spines, he
tells us, the state has decreed that their  consumption--and
even  their  possession--are  too  hazardous to the people's
health to be permitted . . . even by knowledgeable,  willing
adults.   Perhaps it is because citizens' bodies are thought
to be government property, and therefore it is the  function
of the state to punish those who improperly care for govern-
ment  property.    Or perhaps it is because the state gener-
ously extends to competent adults the ""benefits"" it provides
to children and to the mentally ill:  namely,  a  full-time,
all-pervasive supervisory conservatorship--so that they need
not  trouble  themselves  with making choices about behavior
thought physically risky or morally ""naughty.""  But, in  any
case,  you  stare stupefied, while your Eskimo informant re-
lates how this law is taken so seriously that  a  friend  of
his was recently imprisoned for years for the crime of ""pos-
session of nine ounces of trout with intent to distribute.""

     Now  you  may  conclude  that  a society so grotesquely
oppressive as to enforce a law of this  type  is  simply  an
affront to the dignity of all human beings.  You may go far-
ther  and  decide to commit some portion of your discretion-
ary, recreational time specifically to the task of thwarting
this tyrant's goal.  (Your rationale may be ""altruistic""  in
the   sense   of  wanting  to  liberate  the  oppressed,  or
""egoistic"" in the sense of  proving  you  can  outsmart  the
oppressor--or  very likely some combination of these or per-
haps even other motives.)

     But, since you have zero desire to become a  martyr  to
your ""cause,"" you're not about to mount a military campaign,
or  even try to run a boatload of fish through the blockade.
However, it is here that technology--and in  particular  in-
formation technology--can multiply your efficacy literally a
hundredfold.    I say ""literally,"" because for a fraction of
the effort (and virtually none of  the  risk)  attendant  to
smuggling in a hundred fish, you can quite readily produce a
hundred  Xerox copies of fishing instructions.  (If the tar-
geted government, like present-day America, at least permits
open  discussion  of  topics  whose  implementation  is  re-
stricted,  then that should suffice.  But, if the government
attempts to suppress the flow of information as  well,  then
you will have to take a little more effort and perhaps write
your  fishing manual on a floppy disk encrypted according to
your mythical Eskimo's public-key parameters.  But as far as
increasing real-world access to fish you have  made  genuine
nonzero  headway--which  may  continue to snowball as others
re-disseminate the information you have provided.   And  you
have not had to waste any of your time trying to convert id-
eological  adversaries, or even trying to win over the unde-
cided.  Recall Harry Browne's dictum  from  ""Freedom  in  an
Unfree World"" that the success of any endeavor is in general
inversely proportional to the number of people whose persua-
sion is necessary to its fulfilment.

     If  you  look  at  history, you cannot deny that it has
been dramatically shaped by men with names like  Washington,
Lincoln,  .  .  .  Nixon  .  . . Marcos . . . Duvalier . . .
Khadaffi . . .  and their ilk.  But it has also been  shaped
by  people with names like Edison, Curie, Marconi, Tesla and
Wozniak.  And this latter shaping has been at least as  per-
vasive, and not nearly so bloody.

     And  that's  where  I'm  trying  to  take The LiberTech
Project.  Rather than beseeching the state to please not en-
slave, plunder or constrain us, I propose a libertarian net-
work spreading  the  technologies  by  which  we  may  seize
freedom for ourselves.

     But here we must be a bit careful.  While it is not (at
present)  illegal  to  encrypt  information  when government
wants to spy on you, there is no guarantee of what  the  fu-
ture  may hold.  There have been bills introduced, for exam-
ple, which would have made it a crime  to  wear  body  armor
when government wants to shoot you.  That is, if you were to
commit certain crimes while wearing a Kevlar vest, then that
fact  would  constitute a separate federal crime of its own.
This law to my knowledge has not passed . . . yet . . .  but
it does indicate how government thinks.

     Other  technological  applications,  however, do indeed
pose legal risks.  We recognize, for  example,  that  anyone
who  helped a pre-Civil War slave escape on the ""underground
railroad"" was making a clearly illegal use of technology--as
the sovereign government of the United States of America  at
that time found the buying and selling of human beings quite
as  acceptable  as  the buying and selling of cattle.  Simi-
larly, during Prohibition, anyone who used  his  bathtub  to
ferment  yeast and sugar into the illegal psychoactive drug,
alcohol--the controlled substance, wine--was using  technol-
ogy  in a way that could get him shot dead by federal agents
for his ""crime""--unfortunately not to be  restored  to  life
when  Congress  reversed itself and re-permitted use of this
drug.

     So . . . to quote a former President,  un-indicted  co-
conspirator  and pardoned felon . . . ""Let me make one thing
perfectly clear:""  The LiberTech Project does not  advocate,
participate  in, or conspire in the violation of any law--no
matter how oppressive,  unconstitutional  or  simply  stupid
such  law may be.  It does engage in description (for educa-
tional and informational  purposes  only)  of  technological
processes,  and some of these processes (like flying a plane
or manufacturing a firearm) may well require appropriate li-
censing to perform legally.    Fortunately,  no  license  is
needed  for  the  distribution or receipt of information it-
self.

     So, the next time you look at the political  scene  and
despair,  thinking,  ""Well,  if 51% of the nation and 51% of
this State, and 51% of this city have  to  turn  Libertarian
before  I'll  be  free,  then  somebody might as well cut my
goddamn throat now, and put me out of my  misery""--recognize
that  such  is not the case.  There exist ways to make your-
self free.

     If you wish to explore such techniques via the Project,
you are welcome to give me your name and address--or a  fake
name  and  mail  drop, for that matter--and you'll go on the
mailing list for my erratically-published newsletter.    Any
friends  or acquaintances whom you think would be interested
are welcome as well.  I'm not even asking for stamped  self-
addressed envelopes, since my printer can handle mailing la-
bels and actual postage costs are down in the noise compared
with  the  other  efforts  in getting an issue out.   If you
should have an idea to share, or even a  useful  product  to
plug,  I'll be glad to have you write it up for publication.
Even if you want to be the proverbial ""free rider"" and  just
benefit  from  what others contribute--you're still welcome:
Everything will be public domain; feel free to  copy  it  or
give it away (or sell it, for that matter, 'cause if you can
get  money  for  it while I'm taking full-page ads trying to
give it away, you're certainly entitled to  your  capitalist
profit . . .)  Anyway, every application of these principles
should make the world just a little freer, and I'm certainly
willing to underwrite that, at least for the forseeable  fu-
ture.

     I  will leave you with one final thought:  If you don't
learn how to beat your plowshares into  swords  before  they
outlaw  swords,  then you sure as HELL ought to learn before
they outlaw plowshares too.

I have seen various references to 'triple des' recently. Could anyone
tell me what it is ? From context, I would guess that it means
encrypting each block 3 times, with a different key each time, but
I'd like to be sure.

Replies by email preferred - our news is unreliable.

Thanks,

At the risk of getting lost in the clipper chip discussion I give a  
summary on my recent question:

Unfortunately the answer is no - concealing the initialisation vector  
essentially doesn't give any additional security. I got 3 answers (from  
grady@netcom.com, Mark.Lomas@cl.cam.ac.uk, smb@research.att.com) that  
opened my eyes. It's pretty simple:

Say E is encryption (and D decryption) with key K on 64-bit blocks.

Let c[0] be the initialisation vector,
m[1], m[2], ... the message blocks,
c[1], c[2], ... the cipher text blocks.

Then encryption in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode works by the formula

   c[i] = E(m[i] XOR c[i-1]),

and decryption by

   m[i] = c[i-1] XOR D(c[i]).

So if the attacker doesn't have c[0] this only affects the first message  
block m[1]. But she can do her key search attack on m[2], m[3], ...

The situation in cipher feedback (CFB) mode is a bit more complicated but  
similar and left as an exercise for the reader :-)

Finally there is the modified output feedback mode (OFB) where DES (or  
whatever block cipher you use) simply acts as random generator by

   s[i] = E(s[i-1]) with initialisation vector (= seed) s[0],

and encryption is given by

   c[i] = m[i] XOR s[i].

Here the usual `known plaintext' attack against XOR-bitstream ciphers  
reduces the cracking to key search for K.

I do not think they can use the eavesdropping as evidence at all. However,
using the info they gather while listening, they can go searching THE right
place and find good, strong evidence, which they can use in court. 

Question : currently, it is easy to wire-tap, from the technical point of
view, at least. Anybody using the appropriate radio receiver can listen
to communications between a car-telephone and the ground station. The police
also, obviously. The clipper chip will make it much more difficult for the
non-authorized person to eavesdrop (note that I DO NOT write << impossible>> ).
The privacy will thus improve from the current situation. Poeple who REALLY
have something to hide already DO NOT use the phone to speak of these things.
If an illegal operation is really worth, one can afford having critical data
carried by a person rather than sending it electronically. 
The clipper chip will not change this. 

The problem is more politic. Foreign countries will never accept the clipper
chip is the access to the escrow cannot be directly granted to their own
police following their OWN law, not the US law. i.e. each country will have
its own escrow. How then will it be possible to monitor the international
traffic? or, will encrypted international traffic be possible ? or will there
be an international escrow, some kind of U.N. thing ?

Forbidding crypted communication is impractical: how is it possible to spot
a crypted communication in the thousands of megabytes of data which circulate
on the various existing networks. What about private networks ? And this will
be more and more impossible as the volume of electronic traffic will increrase
in the next years.

I think that the clipper chip can only be an interesting device to limit the
risk of , for instance, one's girlfriend's husband listening to his wife's
communications. It will bring no more as regards to security. Is it worth ?
I think so if its cost is limited, I think that many privacy invasions are done
not only by official services, but also by private entities. The clipper can
help reducing these. Provided we do not hope too much of it, it is not a real
danger and it can be helpful.

You are correct (several times). TEMPEST is a codeword for a standard, shared between the NATO governments, to limit the inadvertent emission of information by either electromagnetic radiation or conduction. The limits set in the 
standard are classified but there is open source information to the effect 
that either the electrical or magnetic components of electromagnetism can be 
exploited. It is a basic rule of physics that there is an electromagnetic 
field associated with any path that conducts a flow of electrons.

Among other things, I drive a 1987 Korean built AT clone and an associated 24 pin dotmatrix printer. The major source of unintentional emission is the CRT. To that can be added the video driver card, the RS232 parallel cable and the 
printer head. The emissions from these are gross can be detected with the 
crudest of equipment. Were I to apply good test equipment and some 
intelligence to measuring emission levels, I would find many other potential 
sources of leaked information.

Where cryptography is used for serious purposes, poor TEMPEST protection 
becomes an important security hazard.

In the early eighties, the need to allow some commercial concerns, 
particularly financial institutions, a level of protection against TEMPEST 
threat led to a series of briefings to invited corporations and to the 
'release' of a cut-down TEMPEST stansard for commercial use. I say 'release' 
for while equipment to meet the standard is available (at a price and to 
approved customers) AFAIK even the commercial standard remains classified. If
you think about it, it would really have to wouldn't it?

Evil and good walk hand in hand.  It is also important to note that
the good in the tools lies in the wielder of the tools.

I cannot accept this ridiculous leap in logic.  Technology is neutral
to good or evil.  When technology is used by ""evil"" men, it is called
evil technology.  When it is used by ""good"" men, it is called good
technology.  Really, it is just technology that allows action to be
realized more efficently and on a larger scale.

Try not to confused the development of technology with its use.
Certainly, ""bright"" people will be better at creating technology, but
even young children know how to program VCR machines.  Are VCR
machines not extremely complex to create?

Adaptibility and flexibility is always better at enduring than the
stiff and stubborn.  A young child is soft and supple; an old man is
stiff and inflexible.  A dripping of water can cut through stone.
This has nothing to do with technology, rather technology just
allows us to magnify action.

Let's put it this way, they have a charter and several executive orders
to obey, among other things which *explicitly* prohibit sharing this
information (unless things have changed withing the last little while).
I suppose they could ignore it, if they choose.  But I doubt they would.

Okay, folks, I know I'm in the minority on this issue, but I can't
let this assertion go unchallenged yet again.  I'm going to say this
ONLY ONCE, in the hopes of NOT starting a flame war off of the main
topic.

Guns are offensive.  Cryptography is defensive.  See the difference?
The only way you can use a gun is to hurt somebody else.  Crypto-
graphy helps prevent other people from hurting you.

Sorry for the digression.  Let's not forget the issue that we DO
agree on: We want continued access to crypto technology of our
choice, without key registration.

Wouldn't this method be vulnerable against a ""birthday"" attack?
Currently a cracker needs to find the _only_ (*1) key that produces
the given ciphertext.  He has to try about 2^63 keys on the average.
In the proposed method the cracker only needs _any pair_ of key halves.
If he can store about 2^32 guesses for one half, he is likely to find
a mathching pair in about 2^32 guesses.  (Here I have assumed that the
DES-encryption is reversable, if the key is guessed.  Is this so or do
the modifications of the S-boxes by the salt bits make it non-reversable?)

*1 Probably there is only one key; I think there is 1 chance in about 128
that there are two or more keys (can anyone verify this?), but this doesn't
help the cracker much.

Since you asked, the above is a bit inaccurate. More accurate is that the
government says its solid, other people in the field who might be able to
find out haven't yet done their review of the chip design, and there's been
a lot of wild speculation and guesswork from those with little information
that it might be Swiss cheese.

One unreliable data point: while looking over the shoulder of a

Are you sure that the field is in the area you found the antenna
farm?  The tomb (""Ymvos"") of Marathon which Herodotus specifies as near
the fighting area is in an area open to the public.

You must be referring to the U.S. army base of ""Nea Makri"".  It was
built by the U.S. in the same manner as bases all over the world
(W. Germany, Spain, Philippines, Turkey etc.) were built.  I think
it was a telecommunications hub.  Over the recent years U.S. forces
have withdrawn from the base and removed all military equipment.  The
area is currently under the control of the Greek Navy until the all
interested parties (local goverment, central goverment, political parties
agree on what should be done with the land (park, recreation area,
real-estate.)

(This has nothing to do with cryptography, security and the EFF; I have
redirected followups to soc.culture.greek)

Far more effective than mass mailing of a standard letter (this is taken

Perhaps Nathaniel Sammons or someone else would like to prepare a set of

Actually, it's not quite that bad, but it's close.

Look, we (collectively) have the power to throw the bums out, but we
don't use it.  We clearly don't need to go burning things down, but we
clearly do need to throw at least some of the bums out.
Unfortunately, the bums have learned to target only small groups of
people at a single time, so the masses won't react and throw them out.
Eventually, the masses will react, unless the bums cease their
relentless encroachment on liberty and despoilment of the economy.
The sooner it happens, the less the damages will be.  I don't want to
live in a war zone, either -- I want to see the bums thrown out before
they do some *real* damage.

It is said that CELP vocoders can run on the highest speed 486s with
some room to spare -- they turn 64kbit (8 bit samples, 8k samples/sec)
into 4800 baud. However, DSP is hairy, and I have yet to see actual
proof of this in the form of an implementation. I have heard fairly
reliable rumors to the effect that a famous internetworking guru has a
CELP implementation that runs on Sparcstation 1+'s with some room to
spare, but I have not succeeded thus far in getting my hands on a copy
-- the guru in question has a reputation for not releasing code
without having beaten on it for a very very long time first. 

DSP experts are heavily encouraged to try their own hand at this
problem.

Qualcomm had spare cycles in the DSPs for their new CDMA digital
cellular phones. They wanted to put strong crypto into them since they
had the capacity. The government decided to ""discourage"" them.

Really, none of this stuff is especially hard. All you need for a true
private phone is an ISDN codec, a vocoder (either a chip or
software), an encryptor (a chip is fine, but software is more than
fast enough), a V.32 or V.32bis modem module, and maybe a
microcontroller to run the whole thing. Its easy to do, its cheap. And
any ""normal"" company trying to put one out will likely get a visit
from the boys in the dark suits from Washington, just like Qualcomm
did. I suspect that companies like Cylink are tolerated because their
products are too expensive.

However, no law yet stops one from building really private phones, in
spite of the hints the administration has made when discussing the new
""crime bill"" and in connection with the Clipper/Skipjack Big Brother
chip. Someone out there WILL build a unit to do all this. Better yet,
prehaps someone will produce a package that turns any 486 box with a
sound card into a secure phone.

  The reason I could theoretically trust Apple (though I'm a PC person

them if they screw up badly enough.  The government doesn't have any such
worry; it can change the rules by force to get the outcome it wants.  This
is the ultimate reason why private enterprise is usually more efficient
than government agencies.

There's an out for him.  The announcement talked about strong cryptography
I believe.  Specifically:

I am not claiming that we private citizens should have access to the NSA's
best, secret algorithms.  I don't want any NSA algorithms, actually.

I'll let them break my pitiful amateur algorithms -- and RSA's.

All I want is what I have already -- the ability and right to invent and use
my own algorithms, share them with my friends and sell them.

OK, Andrew, I'll provide some evidence. A friend of mine worked for an
electronics manufacturer on with a west-coast office. They routinely sold
equipment to the Japanese. One day, the Japanese started showing up with
discount demands that were amazingly close to the cost to manufacture the
products.

This company routinely sent most of the manufacturing data to the field 
offices. The Japanese had simply intercepted it. So my friend, the computer
systems admin, came up with a solution. He started sending the data out
double-block-encrypted with DES. 

Two days after this new distribution plan was implemented, the president of
the company got a visit from a pair of government agents. They told him to
""knock it off"". The president gave in, since his company did a considerable
business with the federal government.

Now, if the government wasn't monitoring the communications, how would they
even know that the encryption system was installed? Further, since encryp-
tion isn't illegal, and DES certainly isn't, what is the basis of the
government's cease-and-desist demand?

The spooks do whatever they think is necessary, with or without the blessings
of the law. I'll say ""no thanks"" to Clipper, or anything else the government
produces. For the moment, double or triple DES is probably adequate. And when
the line is idle, send random garbage, just to keep 'em busy.

Interesting.  Tell us, what happens if I were to say OK, I want to have

You see, I am kind of nervous, because in the last month or so, I have
seen a non-stop stream of ideas coming out of Wash DC that at least
appear VERY STRONGLY to have a common trait to limit privacy (freedom
from Govt eavesdropping), and the ability to defend ourselves against
violent attack (no, 911 is *NOT* good enough for 'common folk', they
arrive only in time to clean up the mess: I would be DEAD if I had to
depend on 911...).   You see, with all that talk about National smart
ID cards, limiting of encryption to 'government approved', denial of
means to effective personal defense (EIGHT bills in congress right now),
it looks an AWFULLY lot like the whole thing is to be able to trace
EVERY ACTIVITY of an individual from cradle to grave.  All it would take
is requiring that National ID card to be used in all transactions...
and with no effective data protection, and with the people suitably
disarmed, there would not be a helluva lot they could do about it, now
would there?  All in the name of the War on the Constitu ... er ...
drugs, and of course that catch word 'terrorists'.  What is wrong with
good OLD-FASHIONED POLICE WORK to build a case?  They don't want to
have to be burdened to leave the office, it seems...

Please read the Bill of Rights (first ten amendments to the US
Constitution) and tell us how you can reconcile this Big Brother-ish
policy of the Administration (always for a 'crisis' of some kind, isn't
it?) with that Bill of Rights in the context of the people who wrote
it?

Reassure us - please... (or is that no longer regarded as necessary,
seeing as apparantly the people have NO input on this agenda, the
Administration preferring to make all the DECISIONS in secret, then
springing it on us...).  Doesn't sound much like ... by the PEOPLE
to me.  I cannot help notice that the congress people involved were
NOT mentioned on the press release.  I find that more than a little
bit curious, don't you?  I sure would like to know who to not vote

Yes, I am upset.  I feel you are a part of this, because I recall it
was you that was posting HEAVILY in favor of a very similar idea (could
have been the SAME thing, it was so close) a few months ago...  I
also recall it was not well received.  Apparantly powers-that-be
really didn't care (or were not told, or both).

From what I see, Clipper will ONLY be useful for conversations I don't
want the neighborhood kid listening in on.  Any SERIOUS security I don't
think I would want to trust it a bit.  Might as well use cleartext.
Certainly corporations would be rather dumb to depend on this for serious
trade-secret data, especially if millions depended on that security.
Given enough money, one could BUY any keys they wanted.  Buy a crooked
judge, and a crooked cop.   Given a few hundred thou, they wouldn't be
hard to find.  So, we end up with only criminals, terrorists, and the
Government with real security, and the ability to eavesdrop.  You know
the first two, if they are serious, ain't going to use this thing for
THEIR communications.  I bet the government won't, either (except perhaps
to order a pizza).

Tell us, will that be prima face evidence of criminal activity,
someone not using the 'government approved' methods?  That just a desire
to have PRIVACY is no longer regarded as a legitimate right of an
unconnected citizen?  Will that be grounds for a fly-through-the-door
raid, and confiscation of all one's equipment, as 'terrorist tools',
using civil forfeiture, so there will be no inconvenient need to
PROVE any wrongdoing on the part of the citizen?

I have yet another question, are we going to see articles in all the
public magazines, consisting of soothing text telling us how great
this is, how nice the government is by LETTING us have this illusion
of privacy?  That the government is going to be so kind as to let
us 'sort of' exercise a RIGHT?  What you want to bet that I am
correct here?

Please answer these questions.  As citizens of the United States, we
hava a RIGHT to know what our Government plans to 'let' us have
out of the goodness of their hearts...

Funny thing, though - with all these proposals, I don't feel ONE BIT
safer from drug dealers, terrorists, or a common street thug.  I am
beginning to wonder if the greater danger lies in the above entities,
or our own government gone out of control?

Re-assure us, please.  So far, I haven't seen much to reassure me...
and a LOT to greatly disturb me.

Let me give you another story that actually happened to ME.  We sell
communications boards that use a 68000.  They used to be high tech. Our
agent in the UK sold a system to a company in CH which packaged it in a
product for CZ (London-Bern-Prague).  I telexed the Brits and told them
the Swiss need to pass export paperwork through the US as, at the time,
you needed an export lisence for these systems.

Now I knew the NSA was watching this traffic (just like they are watching
THIS traffic.)

And what do you know... two weeks later an agent of the US government shows
up in my office to remind me if we or our agents sold systems into the Evil
Empire, we had better make sure the export lisences were handled properly.

He was part of a FIVE man office in COLUMBUS OHIO!! who did this stuff
based on sources he could not reveal. (I assume most of the time these
guys sat around the office with their thumbs up their ass as there isn't
that much stuff coming out of Columbus :)

Wow, the electric utility in Prague sure is a big worry for these folks :)

The point is, we have created a giant bureaucracy (NSA) with a budget
bigger than the CIA's who, like all bureaucracies, fill their time looking
for things to do.  The Evil Empire is gone.  The NSA is not.  They will do
something to fill their time and justify their budgets.  (I just wish they
too would sit around with their thumbs up their ass... but that is too
much to hope for... they will spy on us and do things like skipjack and
subvert people like Dorothy Denning.)  Sigh...

Good idea, But why put all the eggs in one basket?

Given that the escrow keys are generated 200 at a time on floppy disks, why
not keep them there rather than creating one huge database that will have to

Give each floppy to a different bank for safekeeping. The USA has over 10,000

Hmmmmmm.  $30 seems a bit expensive.  How big is the chip?  What kind
of packages will be used?  3 volt or 5 volt technology?  How much
current will it draw?  I think there are many practical questions
that haven't been answered, especially since this chip already exists!

OK, I've got a big problem with all of this.  How in the world do you
expect to sell these chips for even $30 after all the overhead involved
in this programming procedure?  2-4 people, a laptop, only 300 chips at 
a time:  give me a break.  And how long does all of this take?  Even if
it is a minute per chip, it will take the greater part of a day to 
turn out 300 of these things.  How long do you suppose it will take to
program those 10,000 chips mentioned above?  This is highly impractical!

So where can I find info on this AT&T device?  What kind of vocoder

duplex?  How does it sound?  What kind of synchronization scheme is
used?  Will all other little black boxes have to conform to AT&Ts choices
of protocol, etc.?  Will anybody else be allowed to build boxes that
conform to these specifications?

WHen trying to choose a resistor with a tolerance better than 1%, you 
need a trimmer or to screen devices, it can't be made from adding 2 
resitors of 1% value in parallel, since the smaller device will have the 
error of 1% to cope with. 
You have 3 choices;
a) live with the error of 1% tolerance devices for low Q circuits or low 
sensitivity designs
b) buy resistors with better than 1% tolerance (Vishay/Dale)
c) use trimmers or SOT's (Select-On-Test)

The concrete floor accelerates the problem because it is a heat sink and a
colder lead-acid battery self-discharges at a slightly faster rate. That's
why the old wives' tale of sitting it on a piece of wood on the floor works
to help keep from killing the battery as fast ---- it insulates the battery
thermally. It you'll set the battery down on a piece of styrofoam, it will
self-discharge even slower. The best thing would be to attach a small load
such as a small transistor radio with the volume turned down low and leave it
on constantly, but also trickle-charge it every couple days too to ""shallow-
cycle"" the charge in the battery. Such mild ""exercising"" of a lead-acid
battery is the next best thing to completely removing the electrolyte for
storage. If you do remove the electrolyte, may sure you keep separate storage
containers for each cell's electrolyte and put it back into the same cells
when you refill the battery. This isn't so critical for a brand-new battery
in a fully charged state, but will maximize the restored output of an older
battery which may not be fully charged when you remove the electrolyte for   
storage.

There are a number of inaccuracies here:
1) In fact, a colder battery will self-discharge more slowly.  This is why
   batteries should be stored in a COOL, dry place.
2) An battery placed on concrete does not become colder than one placed
   on wood.  The battery, the wood, and the concrete will all be at the
   same general temperature (ignoring temperature fluctuations) and thus
   none will effect the other.

There is no need to 'exercise' the battery.  Just keep it charged.  (A trickle
charger will do the job.)

I have found that are good for audio are LM739 and LM833, but I cannot

Are there any good substitute op-amps and/or are there any parts

Any info would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

My own practice with new software :

make a copy of the original floppies to a second set of floppies.

install to hard drive from second set of floppies.

put originals in a box in room number one.

put copies in box in room number two.

1) Accidents DO happen to original floppies.
2) Accidents CAN happen to the installation floppy.
3) Sometimes software goes out on floppies that are JUST marginally good.  Or
   gets too close to a magnet in shipping or storage.

I've had experience with SOMETHING like the last.  I purchased a compiler from
a reputable vendor.  THe debugger in the package just would NOT install to the
hard drive. NO WAY.  Repeated floppy-to-floppy copies FINALLY got a clean read
of the disk.  I DON'T recall if I used ""diskcopy"", ""copy/b"", or ""xcopy"".

I made a second copy of the marginal floppy and installed from that.  No problenms ( except with my typing :-)  ) since.

I regard backup floppies as CHEAP insurance.

Just my side of the question...

Try a differential amplifier. Put back-to-back diodes between the collectors
restrict the voltage swing. Have 10 mA flow, with 500 ohm collector Rs, and
keep the stray C below 10 pF. Try 2N5179s. Run collector to your logic.

It's NOT the concrete floor that does it. The problem is that lead-acid
cells self discharge over time. Even high quality cells (Gates for instance)
will discharge 50-60% over a 3-5 month period of time. Non-sealed cells
self discharge even faster. If the battery was not completly charged
when left sitting, it probably discharged past the the point where cell
sulfiding occurs, which in many cases means a ruined battery.

I have a DeskJet 500 and I thought I'd give a little info.  The DeskJet 500 WILL
do landscape mode like the HP LaserJets.  I can't say if other inkjets do
though.  Also the DeskJet can do downloadable fonts ONLY if you buy a softfont
memory cart for it.  OH!  You said the LaserJet can rotate a graphic image!
Hmmmmm!  The DeskJet can only rotate text.  Nevermind!

   Where can I buy blinking LEDs besides radio shack? 


  * Does anyone sell blinking LEDs with variable flash rate? (by voltage
    I guess) If so, what hertz (pulse) rate are they adjustable or set to?

     I'd like blinking LEDs that can be set for approx 5 hz, 10 hz, 
     15 hz, or 20 hz. Something like that... I'm interested in what's
     out there for flash rates. I like the idea of LEDs with flasher 
     circuits already in them. I hate soldering ICs in general. Guess I
     don't have a hell of a lot of patience.

To put it bluntly, they are full of it.

Paying a tape is playing a tape.  There is no difference whether the 
output goes to a second VCR or to a TV.  (How the VCR or TV reacts to 
this signal is a different story - see messages pertaining to macrovision 
copy protection.)

In order for the tape to self-destruct, it would have to have circuitry 
of its own within the tape case.  The circuit would have to somehow 
magically determine what the output of the VCR is connected to.  The 
circuit would then have to have an erasing head to actually do anything.

It is a pretty lame scare tactic.  (I've seen something similar on a BBS.
When the SYSOP wanted to, he could have a message sent to the user's end 
saying that it is sending the code to format your HD.)

X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]


   I thought the first thread was hilarious, so here goes another post.

Some more background information on what has happened to my poor batteries.

  One year, I left the batteries in the garage.  The garage is Unheated.  
They were left in their places that they needed to be.  One in the riding
lawnmower (what a lux) and one in each motorcycle.  The battery in the 
riding lawnmower was about 3-4 years old, and one of the cycle batteries 
was new, and one was around 5 years old.  Upon spring time, I discovered
that all of the batteries were dead, and needed to be recharged.  They all
worked properly, except for the older ones, and they had to be replaced 
about halfway through the summer.  (they had originally been stored
in the garage, and I think I remember my dad charging them in spring)
  Last year, I decided to bring them in to the basement, which has two parts.
one is dirt and brick, and the other is concrete.  I brought in all three, and
discovered in the spring, (about 15 days ago) that not only were the batteries
dead, but when I put the charger on them, the charger said ""HMMMMMMMM"" and 
the amp-meter read around 1,000,000,000  (In other words, it was pinned)
the internal circut tripped, and I went on to the other batteries.  They
were the same.  
   Realizing that we still had 2 GIGANTIC sailboat batteries, also lead
acid, I decided to put the charger on them.  (these had been sitting for around 1 and a half years, on the brick and dirt part) and noticed that they only
needed a small charge, around 2 hours or so on trickle.  I tested them
by using them at the local gas station for giving jump starts, and they
worked fine for around 25 of 'em. 
  This leads me to believe one of several things.
     1) I bought really #$%tty batteries last year. (sorta true)
     2) the concrete has something to do with the discharge of the
        batteries.
     3) There was enough moisture to short out the terminals in the 
          room where the concrete is, 
     4) The dirt room was able to absorb the moisture in the air
         better than concrete.

(BTW, I can almost waterski in the dirt room)  

   Any other ideas?

Wrong, wrong, completely wrong (and a little misleading, too).

White noise is random noise whose energy density is constant for a
constant bandwidth. That is, a 5 Hz wide band at 20 Hz will have precisely
the same amount of energy as a 5 Hz band at 20 kHz.

Pink noise is random noise whose energy density is constant for a constant
precentage bandwidth. Thus, a 5% wide band of noise at 20 Hz (whose
bandwidth is 1 Hz) will contain the same energy as a 5% wide band at 20
kHz (whose bandwidth is 1000 Hz wide). 

White noise is often used with spectrum analyzers that have constant
bandwidths, pink noise is used with audio-type real-time analyzers whose
bandwidths are centert-frequency dependent (often described as ""1/3
octave"" or ""1/2 octave"" or some such terminology).

White noise, relative to pink noise, has more energy at high frequencies
(at a rate equal to 3 dB per octave). Pink noise, relative to white noise,
has more energy at low frequencies (at a rate equl to, again, 3
db/octave).

	Greetings. There are 3 types of warnings on (US) tapes:

	1) A hologram is glued across the seam of the 2 halves of the
	   tape. The message usually reads, ""If seal is broken, you must
	   buy this tape""

	2) The standard ""MacroVision"" warning, ""Copies of this tape will
	   be unviewable""

	3) [your case] Extended message for the Average Consumer (tm) which
	   states that even attempting to copy the tape will destroy the
	   original. I don't believe you can sue them for misinformation
	   in cases like this :-)

	Take care.

	P.S. Of course, #3 is utter BS - but the Average Consumer (tm)
	     believes it. Heck, my mom once returned such a tape without
	     watching it... she was afraid that something might just 
	     happen :-)

Back in high school I worked as a lab assistant for a bunch of experimental
psychologists at Bell Labs.  When they were doing visual perception and
memory experiments, they used vector-type displays, with 1-millisecond
refresh rates common.

So your case of 1/200th sec is quite practical, and the experimenters were
probably sure that it was 5 milliseconds, not 4 or 6 either.

I, some years ago, almost became a victim of this.  Squirted a fair amount in
an old model 15 Teletype which was acting up, then turned it on.  The eruption
when the motor starting contacts broke was mighty spectacular... I almost got
my eyebrows singed, the plastic (old ones had safety glass) cover over the
platen, etc flew across the room, and several people in the room almost had
heart attacks.  Beware the explosive properties of WD40 vapor.

If you put another computer on the port instead of the key, you can hack 
them by reading what happens. So I've been told, I've never seen this done 
but I think it's possible. You'd need some hardware knowledge and some 
software to read the port!

Mike, Ring is the RED wire. Tip is the GREEN wire of most standard
phone lines. They two constitute the two wires most often used for
voice telephone (the two live lines). They are the two innermost
connectors of an RJ-11 phone jack.

Another way of telling is that if you measure voltage from RED to
GREEN (ring to tip. tip/green being at ground potential of the
voltmeter), it should read -48 volts in the on-hook no-ring position).
I am 98% sure it's -48 V and not +48 volts. Doesn't hurt a phone too
much if they're reversed, it's just bad if one happens to somehow get
grounded to earth ground elsewhere).

Additionally, when off-hook, the voltage drops to about -4 to -9 Volts
DC. I think it is supposed to correspond to a 36 to 40 mA current
loop. And lastly, when ringing, the two wires develop an AC potential
of about 80 V p-p at 20 to 30 Hz across them (where you get the
electromechanical old fashioned bell ringer from).

Hope that clears things...

Sorry ... should have used correct terminology

1 Quid = 1 Knicker = 1.54 approx U.S. Dollars 

The Terry Pratchett Book ""Good Omens"" contains an adequate explanation

This is just basicly right. The connections that cannot handle touchtone dialing is very few. I would estimate a couple of percents and if you are in a bigger
town, there is none that cannot handle tone dialing.
And regarding our swedish dialing system (a rather screwd up system), that does
just apply to pulsdialing. Not to touchtone.
Btw; Norway is even more interesting. They got both system! So you need different phones depending on where in the country you live.

There are several types of copy protection, and the point is to make sure the
user is using a legitimate copy.  The simplest and virtually fool-proof way is
for the program to somehow fixate itself to the machine it was installed on
(some sort of checksum, serial number, whatever) so a copy put on a different
machine (NOT installed from original disks) will not work.  

The program is definitely backupable, if restored to the same machine (depends
on the programmer...  don't use a disk drive characteristic!)  If the user 
did an upgrade to the machine, he/she should reinstall all programs any way.
No document look-up, no disk wear-and-tear!

I did not say that the originals would allow only one install.  The user's 
conscience should do that.

I know, I'll get flamed for this...  But with the increasing number of ""casual""
users who either unknowingly or don't care about the software copyrights
(It's the truth.  I have ""friends"" who ask me for copies of my latest games
all the time, and when I refused, they went after somebody else.), casual
pirating is becoming more of a problem.  Some sort of copy protection will
discourage the casual copying.  I've seen what some of my ""friends"" dug up
somewhere...  Latest and the greatest games, all cracked, WITHIN days of actual
release!  You know how many bytes you need to change in X-wing to disable
the quiz?  TWO!  Yes, TWO!  (And don't ask me which ones they are.)  Determined
pirates are unstoppable, given enough time, but their results do not spread 
that far, since pirate boards are not that well-known, and easily tracked once
found by authorities.  It is the ""casual"" pirates that the copy protection is
determined to discourage.

What I believe the companies should do is implement the above plus
a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup
""REGISTERED TO XXXXX -- address, city, state zip"" and disables the above.
Two benefits: 1) encourages registration, 2) cuts down on pirating and
makes it more traceable, because if the patch's registration message is
encrypted, it will be quite hard to change, and therefore provides a
stable trail of who allowed their copy out of their hands, and thus
violated their license agreement.

This way, the legitimate users who does not register will experience minimal 
discomfort (who does major upgrades to their computer frequently?) as only
problem they have is they won't be able to restore to another computer.

The registered users would have proven they are legitmate users and therefore
gains full rights, and can restore to different machines.  On the other hand,
the software company now have a record of where THIS particular copy is 
supposed to be.  If this user's copy was found to be somewhere it was not 
supposed to be, we know who has broken their license agreement.  Of course,
a hacker can break that eventually, but that's not the point, is it?

I'll toss in my 2 cents worth - I've begun to think that distribution
disks are made on some of the least reliable floppy disk stocks available.
We've been especially plagued by Borland's distribution disks.  I'm 
lucky if I can install from them as many as 3 times before they crap

to do our installations with.

Subject: Re: Laser vs Bubblejet?
Organization: Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine
Lines: 90

There is a cartridge capping upgrade for older deskjet printers
available from hewlett-packard.  Older original deskjet and
possibly deskjet 500 units may have a black plastic slide with
rubber capping components in the cartrige parking area on the right
side (viewed from front) of the printer.  Newer printers have a
gray or white plastic slide.  The black plastic slide can allow
your cartridge to dry out.  There was and may still be information
packaged with ink cartridges explaining the situation.  HP placed a
coupon for a free upgrade kit to modernize old deskjets to the new
capping mechanism.  I did this on my printer and did indeed find
that the cartidges now last longer.

I don't have the information handy.  I suggest contacting your
nearest HP service center for information on obtaining the kit.

HP has upgrade kits that consist of electronics and mechanical
components that vary depending on the starting level printer and
the level to which you wish to upgrade.  I upgraded my original
desket to a dekjet 500.  The kit was fairly expensive.  You are
likely better off selling your old printer and purchasing a new
deskjet 500 now that prices have declined so much.  Upgrading an
original deskjet to 500 requires a fair amount of skill, but no
soldering.  Upgrading a deskjet plus to a 500 is involves swapping
the processor card and changing a few minor parts.  Contact your HP
service center for further information.

The PCL language used by Deskjets is considerably different from
the PCL used by laser printers, especially the newer laser
printers.  The biggest problem is dumb laser drivers that send a
raster end command after each scan line.  This makes no material
difference for lasers, but causes the deskjet to print the
accumulated raster.  As you might guess, the result is hideously
slow printing.  The new DOS Wordperfect print deskjet drivers are
still guilty of this particular behavior.  From the way Wordperfect
works, this would not be easy to change.  Windows Wordperfect works
efficiently unless you use the DOS drivers instead of Windows'.

The PCL4 dialect used in the Laserjet IIIP allows compression that
permits a full page 300 dpi image to be rendered with only one
megabyte of memory.  An uncompressed image could be as large as
about 909 Kbytes, but the printer needs about 300K of memory for
its internal house-keeping.  Laserjet IV models support banded
printing that allows incrmental download of the image with
compression in limited memory situations.  Deskjet downloadable
fonts are not compatible with laserjet fonts.

A single page from a laserjet only requires about 20 seconds.  This
is faster than any but the most trivial printing from a deskjet
printer.  The presumption, of course, being that the laser printer
has completed its warm-up cyle.

Until ink chemistry is changed, wicking resulting in image
deterioration is unavoidable.  I won't use the word impossible, but
matching laser quality output from a deskjet printer is unlikely.
Chosing an appropriate paper type helps, but does not eliminate the
problem.

Laser printers are more wastful of energy and consumable
components.  HP does accept return of spent toner cartridges,
mitigating the material waste problem to a degree.  Energy waste
could use more work.  Warm-up times have decreased, allowing
stand-by current consumption to be significantly reduced in the
laserjet IV.

Kyocera produces a laser print engine that employs an amorphous
silicon imaging drum with a replacable toner system.  The image
drum is good for approximately 100K copies.  It is a very nice
print engine.  I wish HP used the Kyocera engine.  Kyocera also has
a neat modular paper source and stacker system.

The recommended duty cycle for a deskjet is significantly lower
than any of HP's laser printers.  The pick-up pressure rollers are
subject to wear and I case confirm eventually do wear out.  The
usual symptom is that the printer becomes reluctant to feed paper.
The paper feed is integrated in a transport mechanism that is a
single part from HP service.  Replacement cost for the transport is
almost $200.  The feed rollers are not separately replacable,
though it would not be a difficult job for a competent technician.
I have disassembled and reassembled the transport on my own printer.

It depends upon the application which printer is best for you.  If
you only print 5 or 10 pages a day and are satisfied with the
appearance of output, the deskjet is a very good choice.  As noted,
the deskjet 500 is my choice for personal use.

I have used a product called ""Goof-off"" it comes in a little yellow

It has worked well for removing all kinds of sticker and tape residues.

NOTE: always test a small area in an inconspicuous place before using.

What kind of CSA/UL/FCC approval do $60+ mail-order PC computer

Can I assume that the certification process for small-scale custom hardware
(ie digital/analog circuitry) is reduced, or even eliminated, if I use
such a case and (certified) power supply?

Also, assuming that I use a ""certified"" power supply, have I satisfied the
requirements of CSA/UL approval, and possibly FCC approval as well?
Do mail-order PC cases satisfy FCC certification?  Is FCC certification
even necessary for scientific (non-commercial/non-residential) use?

The output from this chip is basicly a pixel clock, and has various

Hello there.  The other day I was feeling a tad nostalgic and thought
about constructing an old-time crytal radio set.  I figured on
substituting a modern germanium diode for the crystal, and winding the
antenna coil, etc., myself.

The only problem I seem to have is in locating a source for a tuning
capacitor -- you know, the old meshed-plate variable condensers which
used to be the mainstay for tuning circuits.  Well these things seem to
be all but extinct in their original catalog habitats.  Trimmer
capacitors are relatively abundant, but are not really suitable for this
application.

So, can anyone point me to a supplier of tuning capacitors in the 
0--360 pF range?

Manythanks.

  Well, Bertil, you might laugh, but in many places here in Austria, there are
no wall jacks yet, either - just wires sticking out of the wall (and put into
a closed, often sealed, box) :-)
  As far as I remember from Germany, it is a nicely mixed situation - somebody
had wires sticking, somebody had jacks...
  On the other hand, everywhere in Bohemia I have seen wall jacks, and never
seen just wires sticking out of the wall... And I thought Slovakia was the
same case. Well...

   This is called silver bearing solder.   It is used to solder to
devices that have silvered contacts.   One application is soldering
to the ceramic terminal strips used in the old Tektronix scopes.   These
were notched ceramic strips that were silver plated in the notches.
If you used ordinary solder the molten metal would disolve the silver
off of the ceramic.   The silver was quite thin.   The 2% is a saturated
solution of silver in tin and lead.    Thus, no more silver can be
disolved in the solder solution.   Other devices that use silver contacts
are quartz crystals and ultrasonic transducers.

Yet another suggestion, but this one is non-toxic (although I would handle
it like any other cleaner) and it smells nice.  The chemical is called
d-Limonene, and it smells like lemon peels (I think it is a lemon extract
of some kind).  You might find it in a hardware store, sold as a
general-purpose solvent, but your best bet would be any bike store --
it is used as a chain-cleaning fluid.  It works on sticker glue, crayons,
grease, oil, etc.

It's clear yellow in the bottle, and you can use it straight; if you add
water, it changes to a creamy consistency, which is good for some jobs.

I know for sure that the Everex Magic I/O EV-170A can be jumpered
for a printer mode, or for a general purpose bidirectional I/O mode.

Also, I know for sure that the IBM Technical Reference says the following
about the Monochrome Display & Printer Adapter and the IBM Parallel Printer
Adapter:

    It is essential that the external device not try to pull these
    lines [referring to the data lines] to ground.

And later:

    If an external device should be driving data on these pins (in
    violation of usage ground rules) at the time of an input, this
    data will be `or'ed with the latch contents.

I will accept no responsibility if you incur damages of any kind
as a result of my saying, ``I DO NOT know for sure, but I think
you should be able to use a traditional parallel port as an input
port by writing 0x to the data lines, and then reading from the
data lines, while an external device drives them.''  The input
data will not be latched, so noise could make this infeasible.

I am not sure about this, but I believe that Analog Devices in Norwood,

Well, the fastest, crudest mixer (aside from just physically connecting
all your inputs together directly) is to run each signal through a 
resistor to a common output.  The resistors give some isolation so the
signal sources aren't driving directly into each other. 

Taking a wild, seat-of-the-pants guess, I'd say that if you are mixing
high-impedance sources like some dynamic mikes, electric guitar pickups,
etc., your resistors ought to be maybe 5K - 10K or so.  If you are mixing
line-level stuff or the outputs of a Walkman, or such, I'd go with 1K.

input 1 --/\/\/\/ -------------+--- output
                               |

I strongly disagree. I think most pirating is done by amateurs, who won't
copy the program if ""diskcopy"" can't do it.
If you're talking a 20% max goal of pirated copies, I bet that anything that
will beat diskcopy, and can't be easily copied from a hard drive, will
suffice.
I hate hard copy manuals, and would rather have all docs online - *not*
because I want to copy the program, but because its usually faster and
and convenient than sifting through an old book I can't find.

Off deeper end-> Why does everyone think they need to be able to make a 
backup copy? Almost all new software must be installed to the hard disk,
so you are left with the originals as your backups. I think its a waste
of time, space, and money, as well as it makes it to tempting to ""lend""
out the backups.

It had one custome chip (not an ASIC in the sense that word is now understood):
the TIA (sometimes known as the 6526, although most other manufacturers list
that as the CIA complex interface adapter.)  TIA stands for Television
Interface Adapter, and it handles sound, paddles and the minimal video hardware
the 2600 possessed.

There was also a standard 6532 RAM, I/O, Timer (RIOT), plus a voltage
regulator and (if memory serves) a 555 timer.  That's all.

>Later model 2600
>might have incorporated many of the chips into one ASCI, as the weight

Not according to the servicing documentation I have here.  The 2600 did not
change intenally very much at all.

>Additionally, I think the 2600 used 2K, 4K, and up to 8K of ROM for
>their games. 

ROMS were mapped into the upper 4K of the 6507's address space.  2K and 4K
games were fine, but later 8K and 16K games needed bank switching.  Atari
(and others) made much of these ""huge"" cartridges.

>I have no idea how much RAM it had to work with, but I
>would hazard a guess of 2 or 4K RAM. 

Wrong, it had 128 bytes of RAM from the RIOT.  This was multiply mapped into
both page 0 (pseudo-registers) and page 1 (stack), and also throughout the
bottom 4K of memory.  TIA registers also sat in this address space.

As 128 bytes of RAM was somewhat limiting, some later cartridges also carried
RAM themselves, which was interesting as Atari had provided no write line
to the cart.  This was managed by mapping the reads from RAM into one address
range, and the writes into another, but all the time this scheme ate into
the *very* scarce ROM address space.

Just MHO, but I prefer hardcopy books because you can have three or four  
of them open spread across the bed (next to the desk in my dorm) and  
reference them while using the program full-screen.  The Windows Help  
things come closest to good on-line documentation I've seen, but they  
generally aren't detailed enough and would probably take a LARGE amount of  
space (even compressed) which is at a premium on my system . . ..  In  
fact, the manuals are the primary reason I bought Borland's C++ compiler  
instead of using the one the lab licensed (in the lab, of course).  I've  
got a SHELF full of books to help me out when I'm stuck.  :-)   To each  
his own . . . :-)

We've destroyed about six sets of original Microsoft Word for Mac 5.0 and  
Word for Windows (may have been a bad batch of disks).  Don't have the  
faintest idea what happened to them, they just went bad.  Weren't stored  
near any magnetic fields or otherwise mistreated, indeed they were only  
used once.  Given this, and the massive headaches finding a working set of  
disks to fix some of the machines that periodically go down, I'd say  
having working backups is a godsend.  I sure wish we'd had them (Sometimes  
I think Murphy's Law holds true more often than Newton's!!) when we needed  
them.  I think it's sortof like snake antivenin.  99.995% of the time you  
have absolutely no use for it, but when you need it, BOY do you ever need  
it!

I don't have backups of my originals at ""home"" but then my machine doesn't  
see anywhere NEAR the use/abuse of these here at the lab, and so I  
consider it less of a risk.  Still, I usually make ""working copies"" of  
them when I install them and then eventually re-use these ""working copies""  
for something else. . ..


> 
> 
> No flames intended - just my thoughts.

Just mine, too!  :-)

BTW, before anyone notices my mentioning ""copying"" programs from machine  
to machine when we do installs here and wonders about the licensing, the  
upper-management (non-student staff, of course) are METICULOUS in checking  
with providers of the software and making SURE we are sticking to the  
license agreements . . ..

Depends on the environment: in a static environent such as a waveguide yes, in

This depends on the required range, the required accuracy, the allowable

See if Radio Shack has a National Semiconductor Adjustable Voltage 
Regulator, (National) part number: LM350T or LM350K.  These devices are 
rated for an input to output differential of up to 35 Volts @ 3 Amps.

Digi-Key Corp. has these parts, as well as several other useful regulators.
If you don't have their catalog, their phone number is: 1-800-344-4539.

I can only guess that you may intend to recharge a 7.5 VDC nicad battery 
with this device, and if I'm right, you may want to look through some of the 
hobbiest books to get various ideas for battery charging circuits, first.

If you get stuck, e-mail me your FAX number, if you have one, and I'll send

	My brother's affine has recently been diagnosed with Sweet's
syndrome. Also called steroid resistant Sweet's syndrome.

	This syndrome started after she had had Iodine 131 treatment for
hyperthyroidism. She'd been reluctant to have treatment for the
hyperthyroidism for many years and apparently started to show exaustion
from it. 

	I understand that she may still be testing high in thyroid level
but she's isn't being treated by an endocrinologist. Her previous
endocrinologist bowed out when she entered the hospital. She entered the
hospital because of the Sweet's syndrome symptoms (skin lesions).

I've looked through the last two years of Medline and didn't find an
abstract mentioning a correlation between thyroid and Sweets. . 

I checked a handbook which said that Sweet's was associated with leukemia.

I'd like a reccomndation for experts who are in New York City or who travel
to New York City. For the sweets and perhaps for the endocrinology.

Any information that might help. Apparently there hasn't been much
improvement in her condition over the past several months.

No. It's called ""not wiping off the apparatus after taking a picture of the

III. ***** NEWS FROM THE WIRES ******

Sender: Jonathan Lord <jml4s@uva.pcmail.virginia.edu>
Subject: RESURGENCE OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONCERNS CDC
Date: Thursday April 15, 1993

ATLANTA (UPI) --   A resurgence of infectious diseases blamed on newly
emerging viruses and bacteria pose a major challenge for the nation's
health care system, federal health officials said Thursday.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reporting its latest
findings in an investigation of contaminated hamburger meat that
sickened hundreds in 4 states and killed at least four, said it will
put renewed emphasis on battling infectious diseases.

Part of that emphasis includes a new series titled ""Emerging
Infectious Diseases"" to be featured in the CDC's Morbidity & Mortality
Weekly Report, which has a wide circulation in the health community.
The issue also will top the agenda of a two-day meeting of scientific
counselors to update the CDC's draft plan for dealing with the growing
threat of infectious ailments.

""This is an issue that has been coming and we do have a responsibility
to deal with it,"" said Dr. Ruth Berkelman, deputy director of the CDC's
National Center for Infectious Diseases.

There were more cases of malaria in the U.S. in 1992 than in any year
since the 1960s, and Latin America is experiencing a cholera epidemic,
the first in this century, she said.

Resistance of disease-causing agents to antibiotics is also a problem.
""We are seeing much more antibiotic resistance than we have in the past""
Berkleman said.  She said even common ear infections frequently seen in
children are becoming resistant to antibiotic treatment.

""Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious  diseases
would soon be eliminated as a public health problem, infectious diseases
remain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness
and death in the United States,"" the CDC said.

It  cited  the  emergence since the 1970s of a ""myriad"" of newly
identified pathogens and syndromes, such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, a
deadly bacterial infection; the hepatitis C virus; HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS; Legionnaires disease; Lyme disease; and toxic shock syndrome.

""The incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control,
such as cholera, malaria and tuberculosis, have increased in many areas,""
the CDC said.  It said efforts at control and prevention have been
undermined by drug resistance.

HEADLINE: Lyme-Disease Ruling Raises Liability Issues

The tick that causes Lyme disease may have found a new way to cause
damage: legal liability.

A federal judge's decision holding a property owner liable for not
doing enough to protect workers from Lyme disease is getting as much
attention as the latest medical study on the disease, a flu-like
illness that can cause severe physical and mental disabilities and in
rare instances death. The decision last week has put property owners
on notice that they may have to do more than protect themselves from
the ticks-they also may have to protect themselves from litigation if
someone becomes infected while on the property.

The decision by U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward in New York came
after a week-long trial in a case involving four track workers for the
Long Island Railroad. Judge Ward found that the workers contracted the
disease after they were bitten by ticks while on the job. He ordered
the New York state-owned commuter line to pay the workers more than
$560,000 to compensate for pain and suffering, in addition to medical
expenses and lost wages.

Summer camps, schools, companies with facilities in rural or
semirural areas, and homeowners who rent to vacationers are among the
groups that need to be worried about this ruling, says Stephen L.
Kass, an attorney at New York law firm Berle, Kass & Case, who wrote a
legal article three years ago warning property owners of the potential
liability. Even a family that invites friends over for a backyard
barbecue might be potentially liable.

Lawsuits for insect bites, while rare, aren't unheard-of. A summer
vacationer in Southampton, N.Y., last year sued the owner of the home
she rented, claiming that a tick on the property gave her Rocky
Mountain spotted fever. In 1988, also on Long Island, a jury ordered
an outdoor restaurant to pay more than $3 million to a patron who was
stung by a bee, causing an allergic reaction and permanent
quadriplegia. The judge later threw out the award, citing no evidence
that a beehive was near the restaurant.

But lawyers say that the attention to Lyme disease throughout the
country -- it's most prevalent in New England, the Middle Atlantic
states, Wisconsin, Minnesota and the Northwest -- may make this
particular insect bite a particularly litigious one.

The illness already has proved to be a source of controversy in the
courtroom over such issues as the type of medical care insurers will
cover and medical malpractice claims against doctors for not
diagnosing the disease.

Lawyers say worker's-compensation claims related to Lyme disease
have become common in some states in recent years. Payments in
worker's-compensation cases, however, are limited to medical costs and
lost earnings.

The case before Judge Ward dealt with a potentially much more
lucrative avenue for damages, because it involved the question of
negligence. Unlike the worker's compensation process, the law governing
injuries to rail workers allows for a finding of negligence and, as a
result, for additional payments for pain and suffering. Property
owners and lawyers say that negligence claims can be made in many
other situations where people are exposed to the ticks that carry the
disease.

Ira M. Maurer, a partner at New York law firm Elkind, Flynn &
Maurer, who represented the rail workers, says the decision will help
to establish ""the duty of all sorts of property owners to protect
against Lyme disease.""

Lawyers caution that despite Judge Ward's decision, winning a
lawsuit for damages caused by Lyme disease may prove difficult. For
one thing, victims have to demonstrate that they have pinned down when
and where they got the tick bite. Judge Ward found that the plaintiffs
in the railroad case got Lyme disease while working on property owned
by the railroad, even though none of the men remembered being bitten.
The workers, who weren't outdoorsmen likely to be exposed elsewhere to
the insects, said they saw ticks in the high grass that surrounded
some work sites.

A spokeswoman for the railroad says that there was no proof that
the four men were bitten while on the job and that the railroad is
considering an appeal. The railroad also disputes Judge Ward's finding
that it didn't do enough to protect employees. The spokeswoman says
the railroad provides track workers with insect repellent and special
pants to protect against bug bites.

Debate in the scientific community over Lyme disease could open up
some legal defenses for property owners, such as questioning whether a
victim actually has the disease rather than some other illness.
Earlier this week, the Journal of the American Medical Association
reported that doctors overly diagnose patients as having Lyme disease.
And damages awarded to a victim also might be influenced by medical
disputes over the degree of harm that Lyme disease causes.

Because of health and safety concerns, some groups and companies
already take special measures to protect against Lyme disease. Last
year, at its headquarters in Franklin Lakes, N.J., Becton, Dickinson &
Co. began using Damminix, a pesticide made by EcoHealth Inc. of Boston
that is designed to kill ticks carrying the disease. The medical-
supply company's headquarters include a 120-acre park, and the company
was worried that employees who walk on its trails for recreation might
get infected.

Ruth Lister, a spokeswoman for the American Camping Association in
Indianapolis, says that many youth camps accredited by her
organization also have begun to check children for ticks. And Carole
Katz, a member of the board of the Fire Island Pines Property Owners
Association, says her group spends $30,000 each year to treat their
100-acre site off the coast of New York with the tick-killing
pesticide.

TITLE: Urinary dysfunction in Lyme disease.
AUTHORS: Chancellor MB; McGinnis DE; Shenot PJ; Kiilholma P; Hirsch IH,
Department of Urology, Jefferson Medical College, Thomas Jefferson
University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
REFERENCE: J Urol 1993 Jan; 149 (1): 26-30

Lyme disease, which is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, is
associated with a variety of neurological sequelae.  We describe 7 patients
with neuro-borreliosis who also had lower urinary tract dysfunction.
Urodynamic evaluation revealed detrusor hyperreflexia in 5 patients and
detrusor areflexia in 2.  Detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia was not
noted on electromyography in any patient.  We observed that the urinary tract
may be involved in 2 respects in the course of Lyme  disease: 1) voiding
dysfunction may be part of neuro-borreliosis and 2) the spirochete may
directly invade the urinary tract.  In 1 patient bladder infection by the
Lyme spirochete was documented on biopsy.  Neurological and urological
symptoms in all patients were slow to resolve and convalescence was
protracted.  Relapses of active Lyme disease and residual neurological
deficits were common.  Urologists practicing in areas endemic for Lyme
disease need to be aware of B. burgdorferi infection in the differential
diagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunction.  Conservative bladder
management including clean intermittent catheterization guided by urodynamic
evaluation is recommended.

Subject: Question on Lyme Vectors and Compost Piles

  When I visited my sister on Long Island, NY, I was cautioned to avoid the
compost heap in her back yard, as she thinks this is where she became
infected.

  A friend of mine here in Oregon who has a compost heap would like me to
back that claim up with documentation.  Do lyme-carrying ticks hang out in
compost heaps?
Thank you.

I do not have enough medical expertise to have much of an opinion
one way or another on hidden candida infections.  I can
understand the skepticism of those who see this associated with
various general kinds of symptoms, while there is a lack of solid
demonstration that this happens and causes such general symptoms.
(To understand this skepticism, one only needs to know of past
failures that shared these characteristics with the notion of
hidden candida infection.  There have been quite a few, and the
proponents of all thought that the skeptics were overly skeptical.)

On the other hand, I am happy to read that some people are
sufficiently interested in this possibility, spurred by
suggestive clinical experience, to research it further.  The
doubters may be surprised.  (It has happened before.)

I realize that admitting ignorance in the face of ignorance may
not endear me to those who are so sure they know one way or
another.  (And, indeed, perhaps some of them do know -- I am the
one who is currently ignorant.)  But I find this the most honest
route, and so I am happy with it.

It isn't bogus.  I had chronic vaginal yeast infections that would go away
with cream but reappear in about 2 weeks.  I had been on 3 rounds of
antibiotics for a resistant sinus infection and my husband had been on
amoxicillin also for a sinus infection.  After six months of this, I went
to a gynecologist who had me culture my husband seminal fluid.  After 7
days incubation he had quite a bit of yeast growth (it was confirmed by
the lab).  A round of Nizerol for him cleared both of us.

Yup.  The demonstration to which you refer consists of placing a leaf between
the plates, and taking a Kirlian photograph of it.  You then cut off part of
the leaf, put the top plate back on, and take another Kirlian photograph.  You
see pretty much the same image in both cases.  Turns out the effect isn't
nearly so striking if you take the trouble to clean the plates between
photographs.  Seems that the moisture from the leaf that you left on the place
conducts electricity.  Surprise, surprise!

David, this study looks like a good one.  Gordon Rubenfeld did a Medline 
search and also sent me the same reference through e-mail.  Since 
commercial yogurt does not always have a good Lactobacillus a. or 
bulgaricus culture, a negative finding would not have been too informative.
This is often the reason why Lactobacillus acidophilus tablets are 
recommended rather than yogurt.

I guess the next question is why would this introduction of ""good"" bacteria 
back into the gut decrease the incidence of vaginal candida blooms if the 
anus was not serving as a candida reservoir(a fact that Gordon R. vehementy
denys)?  I see two possible theories.  One, the L. acidophilus, which is a 
facultatively anaerobic bacterium, could make it through the gut and 
colonize the rectal area to overgrow the candida.  This would not explain 
the reoccurance of candida blooms in the vagina after the yogurt ingestion 
was stopped though.  The other is that the additional bacteria in the 
intestinal tract remove most of the glucose from the feces and candida 
looses it's major food source.

Getting Lactobacillus acidophilus to colonize the vaginal tract(where it is 
normally found) would have a much better effect on the recurrance of vaginal 
yeast blooms though.  An acetic acid, Lactobacillus acidophilus douche has 
been used to get this effect but I've not seen any such treatment reported in 
the medical literature.  This would be an example of physicians conducting 
their own clinical trials to try to come up with treatments that help their 
patients.  When this is done in private practice, the results are rarely, if 
ever published.  It was the hallmark of medicine until the modern age 
emerged with clinical trials.  It really raises a big question.  Does the 
medical profession cast out the adventerous few who try new treatments to 
help patients or does it look the other way.

This particular issue is really a very simple one since no real dangerous 
therapy is involved(even the anti-fungals are not all that dangerous).  But 
there are some areas(like EDTA chelation therapy), where the fire is pretty 
hot and somebody could get burned.  It's really tough.  Do I follow only 
well established protocols and then give up if they don't work that well or 
do it try something that looks like it will work but hasn't been proven to 
work yet?

My stand is to consider other treatment possibilities, especially if they

Money probably has a lot to do with keeping the practice of routine 
circumcision alive... It's another opporitunity to charge a few hundred
extra bucks for a completely unnecessary procedure, the rationale for 
which until recently has been accepted without question by most
parents of newborns.  

One could also imagine that complications arising from circumcision
(infections, sloppy jobs, etc) are far more common than the remote chance
of penile cancer it is purported to prevent.

I heard a short blurb on the news yesterday about an herb called feverfew (?)
that some say is good for preventing migraines. I think the news said there
were two double-blind studies that found this effective.

Does anyone know about these studies? Or have experience with feverfew?
I'm skeptical, but open to trying it if I can find out more about this.
What is feverfew, and how much would you take to prevent migraines (if

It is one thing to be open-minded about phenomona that have not
be demonstrated to be false, and quite another to ""believe"" in
something like Krilian photography, where *all* the claimed effects
have be demonstrated to be artifacts.  There is no longer any reason
to adopt a ""wait and see"" attitude about Krilian photography, it
has been experimentally shown to be nothing but simple coronal
discharge.  The ""auras"" shown by missing leaf parts came from 
moisture left by the original whole leaf, for example.  

That's what science is, son.

I am writing this to find out the following:

1.)	Any information on surgery to prevent reflux esophagitis.

2.)	The name(s) of a doctor(s) who specialize in such surgery.

3.)	Information on reflux esophagitis which leads to cancer.

My boyfriend, age 34 and otherwise in good health, was diagnosed with 
reflux esophagitis and a hiatal hernia about 2 years ago.  At that time he 
saw a gastroenterologist and has tried acid controllers (Mylanta, 
Tagamet), as well as a restricted diet and raising the head of his bed.  
These treatments were not effective and because the damage was 
worsening, he opted for a surgical repair 3 months ago.  He was told 
there were two repair techniques that could fix the problem; a Nissen 
wrap and a ""Hill Repair"".  He opted for the ""Hill Repair"". He recovered 
very well from the surgery itself but the pain he had originally is worse 
and in addition he now has trouble swallowing (including saliva).

The doctor now wants to do an endoscopy and has also informed him 
that a biopsy might be necessary if he has a pre-cancerous condition 
which he called ""Barrett's Syndrome"". If he can't avoid having reflux will 
he necessarily get cancer?

Basically, if anyone has any information on what he should do now, I'd 
appreciate it.

Last year, I was totally surprised when my annual physical disclosed an
inguinal hernia.  I couldn't remember doing anything that would have
caused it.  That is, I hadn't been lifting more than other people do,
and in fact probably somewhat less.  Eventually the thing became more
painful and I had the repair operation.

This year I developed a pain on the other side.  This turned out to be
another inguinal hernia.  So I go back to the hospital Monday for
another fun 8-) operation.

I don't know of anything I'm doing to cause this to happen.  I'm 38
years old and I don't think I'm old enough for things to start falling
apart like this.  The surgeon who is doing the operation seems to
suspect a congenital weakness, but if so, why did it suddenly appear
when I was 37 and not really as active as I was when I was younger?

Does anyone know how to prevent a hernia, other than not lifting
anything?  It's rare that I lift more than my 16-month-old or a sack
full of groceries, and you may have noticed that your typical grocery
sack is fairly small these days.  Is there some sort of exercise that
will reduce the risk?

Of course, my wife thinks it's from sitting for long periods of time at
the computer, reading news...

We know that sermon.  It is posted roughly every month or so by different
persons, and that doesn't make it any better.

How did you get the idea that skeptics are closed-minded?  Why don't you
consider the possibility that they came to their conclusions by the
proper methods?  Besides, one can come to a conclusion without closing
one's mind to other possibilities.

I you don't agree with a person, please ask him why he thinks like that,
instead of insulting him.  Perhaps he's right.  Follow your own advice,
be open-minded.

If you don't post a bit of evidence for your claims, I'll complain that
it's always those ""neither a real believer, nor a disbeliever"" types who 
narrow-mindedly judge others without knowing their motives.

Yes, this is a common and safe procedure.  The majority of Schatzki's

I' not an expert on heart problems, but PVC's are common and have been
overtreated in the past.  My personal experience, and I have the same 
history an build you do (related to the heart, that is), is that my PVC's
come and go, with some months causing anxiety.  Taking on more fluids
seems to help, and they seem worse in the summer.  Remember that a slow 
heart rate will allow more PVC's to be apparent, so perhaps it is an

(WITH-COUNTERFLAME-ENABLED

 Columbus was indeed a crank, but not in the manner you think.

 The fact that the world was round was well known when he set sail.  It was
 also well known that the circumference was about 25K miles, and that you could
 not reach Asia bo going west with current technology -- you would neither be
 able to carry enough supplies, nor get a long enough stretch of good sailing
 weather.  Nobody thought he would fall off the edge of the world.  Instead,
 they expected him to die at sea.

 Columbus thought for no good reason that the circumference was only 16K miles,
 making the trip practical.

 Unfortunately for Columbus and his shipmates, the Earth's circumference is
 indeed 25K miles.

 Fortunately for Columbus and his shipmates, there was a stopping place right
 about where Asia would have been had the circumference been 16K miles.

Lida,
I can emphasize with your situation.  Both my wife and I suffered from 
bouts of depression.  Her's was brought on by breast cancer and mine was a 
rebound stress reaction to her modified radical mastectomy and 
chemotherapy.  Lida, I used my knowledge of nutrition to get her through 
her six months of chemotherapy(with the approval of her oncologist).  When 
severe depression set in a few months after the chemo stopped, I tried to 
use supplements to bring her out of it.  I had ""cured"" her PMS using 
supplements and I really thought that I knew enough about the role of diet 
in depression to take care of her depression as well.  It didn't work and 
she was put on Prozac by her oncologist.  Two Winters ago(three years after 
by wife's breast cancer) I got hit with severe depression(pretty typical and 
one reason why many marriages break up after breast cancer or another 
stressor).  I tried to take care of it for several months with 
supplementation.  Didn't work.  My internist ended up putting me on Prozac. 
I was going to give you a list of several studies that have been done using 
B6, niacin, folate and B12 to ""cure"" depression.  I'm not going to do that 
because all you would be doing is flying blind like I was.

Lida, I do believe that depression can have a dietary component.  But the 
problem is that you need to know exactly what the problem is and then use 
an approach which will ""fix"" the problem.  For chemotherapy, I knew exactly 
what drugs were going to be used and exactly what nutrients would be 
affected.  Same thing for PMS.  I was flying blind for both of these 
stressors but the literature that I used to devise a treatment program was 
pretty good.  Depression is just too complicated.  What you really need is 
a nutritional scan.  This is not a diet analysis but an analysis of your 
bodies nutrient reserves.  For every vitamin and mineral(except vitamin C), 
you have a reserve.  The RDA is not designed to give you enough of any 
nutrient to keep these reserves full, it is only designed to keep them from 
being emptied which would cause clinical pathology.  Stress will increase 
your need for many vitamins and minerals.  This is when your reserves become 
very important.

Lida, without your permission, I'm going to use your post as a conduit to 
try to explain to the readers in this group and Sci. Med. where I'm coming 
from.  I have taught a course on human nutrition in one of the Osteopathic 
Medical schools for ten years now.  I've written my own textbook because 
none was available.  What I teach is not a rehash of biochemistry.  I 
preach nutrient reserves(yes my lectures in this course are referred to by 
my students as sermons).  Here is what I cover:

Indroduction and Carbohydrates 			Lipids

Proteins I					Proteins II

Energy Balance					Evaluation of Nutritional
						Status I, A Clinical 
						Perspective

Evaluation of Nutritional Status II,            Evaluation of Nutritional

Thiamin and Niacin				Riboflavin and Pyridoxine

Pantothenic and Folic acids			Biotin and B12

Other Nutrient Factors				Enteral Nutrition

Parenteral Nutrition

Every three years I spend my entire Summer reviewing the Medical literature 
to find material that I can use in my nutrition textbook.  I last did this 
in the Summer of 1991.  I read everything that I can find and then sit down 
and rewrite my lecture handouts which are bound in three separate books 
that have 217, 237 and 122 pages.  Opposite each page of written text(which 
I write myself) I've pulled figures, tables and graphs from various 
copyrighted sources.  Since this material is only being used for 
educational purposes, I can get around the copyright laws (so far).  I can not 
send this material out to newsgroup readers(as I've been asked to do).

I am now in the process of trying to get a grant to setup a nutrition 
assessment lab.  This is the last peice of the nutrition puzzle that I need 
to make my education program complete.  This lab will let me measure the 
nutrient reserve for almost all the vitamins and minerals that are known to 
be required in humans.  The Mayo clinic already uses a similiar lab to 
design supplement programs for their cancer patients.  Cancer Treatment 
Centers of America, which is a private for-profit organization with 
hospitals in Illinois and Oklahoma(Tulsa) also operates a 
nutritional assessment clinical lab.  I also believe that the Pritikin 
Clinic in California has a similiar lab setup.

For physicians reading this post, I would suggest that you get the new 
Clinical Nutrition Textbook that has just been published(Feb) by Mosby.  I 
have been using Alpers Manual of Nutritional Therapeutics(a Little Brown 
series book) as a supplemental text for my course but Alpers is geared more 
to residency training.  Two M.D's have written this new Clinical Nutrition
textbook and it is geared more towards medical student education and it 
does a good job of covering the lab tests that can be run to assess a 
patient's nutritional status.  Let me quote a few sentences from the 
Preface of this new text:

""So-called nutrition specialists were in reality gastroenterologists, 
hematologists, or pediatricians who just happened to profess some knowledge 
of nutrition as it related to their field of practice.""  

""Unfortunately, about two thirds of the medical schools in the United 
States require no formal instruction in nutrition.""

""But times and medical practice have changed.  More than half of the 
leading causes of death in this country are nutrition related.""

""... this monograph should accomplish the following two objectives: (1) it 
should complement your medical training by emphasizing the relevance of 
nutrition to your medical practice; and (2) it should heighten your 
awareness of nutrition as a medical speciality that is vitally important 
for both disease prevention and the treatment of diseases of essentially 
every organ system.""

Roland L. Weinsier, MD, DrPH 

Lida, my advise to you is that you tell your family members to try to find 
a physician who has an understanding of the role that vitamins and minerals
(yes even magnesium may play a role in depression) play in depression and 
who could get a nutritional profile run.  Menopause is often a time when 
women suffer depression.  There are a lot of hormonal changes that are 
occuring but they are not the same ones that occur during PMS.  A 
nutritionist may also be able to help.  Not too long ago a poster mentioned 
that his nutritionist had diagnosed a selenium deficiency based on a red 
cell glutathionine peroxidase test(the specific test for the selenium 
reserve).  Most clinical labs will not run this test and I advised him to 
try to make sure that the lab that did the test was certified.  There are 
also a lot of hair and nail analysis labs setup to do trace mineral 
analysis but these labs are not regulated.  Checks of these labs using 
certified standards, and also those doing water lead analysis, showed some 
pretty shoddy testing was going on.  If you or anyone else finds someone 
who will run these speciality nutrition tests, make sure that they are 
using a lab that has been certified under CLIA(the Clinical Laboratory 
Improvement Act).  

A diet analysis may be helpful since many nutrient reserves have been shown 
to correlate fairly well with the dietary intake as monitored by food logging 
and software analysis(Nutritionist IV and other software programs).  But 
there are still about half of the nutrients required by humans that do not 
show a very good correlation between apparent dietary intake and reserve status.
Until we have more nutritional assessment clinical labs in operation in the 
U.S. and physicians who have been trained how to use the nutritional 
profile that these labs provide to devise a treatment approach that uses 
diet changes and supplementation, anti-depressants will probably continue 
to be the best approach to depression.

Ron, you are absolutely right.  Not all kidney stones have calcium and not 
all calcium stones are calcium-oxalate.  But the vast majority are calcium-
oxalate.  Calcium is just one piece of the puzzle.  I cited that NEJM article 
as a way of pointing out to some of the physicians in this group that 
conventional wisdom is used in medicine, always has been and probably 
always will be.  If one uses conventional wisdom, there is a chance that 
you will be wrong.  As long as the error is not going to cause a lot of 
damage, what's the big deal(why call a physician who gives anti-fungals to 
sinus suffers or GI distress patients a quack?).

On the kidney stone problem.  I'd want a mineral profile run in a clinical 
chemistry lab.  Balance is much more important than the dietary intake of 
calcium.  I know that you use an electrical conductance technique to 
measure mineral balance in the body.  I know that you don't think that the 
serum levels for minerals are very useful(I agree).  If I can get a good 
nutritional assessment lab setup where I can actually measure the tissue 
reserve for minerals, I'd like to do a collaborative study with you to see 
how your technique compares with mine.

I'll tell you all that I know about chromium.  But before I do, I want to 
get a few things off my chest.  I just got blasted in e-mail for my kidney 
stone posts.  Kidney stones are primarily caused by diet, as is heart 
disease and cancer.  When I give dietary advise, it is not intended to 
encourage people reading this news group(or Sci. Med. Nutrition where I do 
most of my posting) to avoid seeing a doctor.  Nothing can be further from 
the truth.  Kidney stones can be caused by tumors and this possibility has to 
be ruled out.  But once it is, diet is a good way of preventing a reoccurance.
Same thing with heart disease and cancer, if you suspect that you may have 
a problem with one of these diseases, don't use what I'm going to tell you 
or what you read in some book to avoid going to a doctor.  You have to go.
Hopefully you will find a doctor who knows enough about nutrition to help 
you change your risk factors for both diseases as part of a treatment 
program(but the odds are that you will not and that's why I'm here).  When 
my wife detected a lump in here breast I didn't say, don't worry my vitamin 
E will take care of it.  Any breast lump has to be worked up by a physician, 
plan and simple.  If it's begnin(which most are) fine, then maybe a diet 
change and supplementation will prevent further breast lumps from occuring.
But let me tell you right now, if you have tried diet and supplementation 
and another lump returns, get your butt into the doctor's office as fast as 
your little feet can carry you(better yet, have a mammography done on a 
regular basis, my wife kept putting her's off, both myself and her 
gynocologist told her she needed to have one done).  Her gynocologist even 
scheduled one, but she didn't show up(too busy running the Operating Room for 
the biggest Hospital in Tulsa).

One more thing, I am not an orthomolecular nutritionist.  This group uses 
high dose vitamins and minerals to treat all kinds of disease.  There is 
absolutely no doubt in my mind that vitamins and minerals can and do have 
drug actions in the body.  But you talk about flying blind, man this is 
really blind treatment.  No drug could ever be used as these vitamins and 
minerals are being used.  I'm not saying that some of this stuff couldn't 
be right on the money, it may well be.  But my approach to nutrition is a 
lot like that of Weinsier and Morgan, the two M.D's who wrote the new 
Clinical Nutrition textbook.  My push is the nutrient reserves and the lab 
tests needed to measure these reserves and then supplementation or diet 
changes to get these reserves built up to where they should be to let you 
handle stress.  That's where I'm coming from folks.  Blast away if you want,
I'm not going to change.  Put me in your killfile if you want, I really 
don't care.  I'm averaging 8-10 e-mail messages a day from people who think 
that I've got something important to say.  But I'm also getting hit by a 
few with an axe to grind.  That's life.

Chromium is one of the trace elements.  It has a very limited(but very 
important) role in the body.  It is used to form glucose tolerance factor
(GTF).  GTF is made up of chromium, nicinamide(niacin), glycine, cysteine 
and glutamic.  Only the chromium and the niacin are needed from the diet to 
form GTF.  Some foods already have GTF(Liver, brewers or nutritional yeast,
and black pepper).  When chromium is in GTF, a pretty good absorption is 
seen(about 20%).  But when it is simply present as a mineral or mineral 
chelate(chromium picolinate) it's absorption is much lower(1 to 2%, lowest 
for all the minerals).  I've been posting in Misc. Fitness and chromium has 
come up there several times as a ""fat burner"".  Chromium is among the least 
toxic of the minerals so you could really load yourself up and not really 
do any harm.  I wouldn't do it though.  The adequate and safe range for 
chromium is 50 to 200ug per day.  The average American is getting about 
30ug per day from his/her diet.  Chromium levels decrease with age and many 
believe that adult onset diabetes is primarily a chromium deficiency.  I 
can cite you several studies that have been done with glucose tolerance in 
Type II diabetes but I'm not going to because for each positive one, there 
also seems to be a negative one as well.  I'm convinced that the problem is 
bioavailability.  When yeast(GTF) is used, good results are obtained but when 
chromium itself is used the results are usually negative.  In addition to 
Type II diabetes, chromiuum has been examined in cardiovascular disease and 
glucoma, again with mixed results as far as cardiovascular disease is 
concerned

Since a high blood glucose level can lead to cardiovascular disease, 
this possible link with chromium isn't too surprising.  Glucoma is a little 
more interesting.  Muscle eye focusing activity is primarily an insulin 
responsive glucose-driven metabolic function.  If this eye focusing activity 
is impaired(by a lack of glucose due to a poor insulin response), intraocular 
pressure is believed to be elevated.  In a fairly large study of 400 pts with 
glaucoma, the one consistent finding was a low RBC chromium. J. Am. Coll. 
Nutr. 10(5):536,(1991).  But this one preliminary study should not prompt 
people to go out and start popping chromium supplements.  For one thing, 
just about every older person is going to have a low RBC chromium unless 
they have been taking chromium suppleemnts(yeast).  Since glucoma is often 
found in older people, it's not too surprising that chromium was low in the 
RBC's.  If chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma, that would 
prompt some attention.  I suspect that there will be a clinical trail to 
check out this possible chromium link to glucoma.

You could find out what your body chromium pool size was by either the RBC 
chromium test or hair analysis.  Most clinical labs are not going to run a 
RBC chromium.  There are plenty of labs that will do a hair and nail 
analysis for you, but I wouldn't use them.  There is just too much funny 
business going on in these unregulated labs right now.

Here's Weinsier and Morgan, advise on chromium.  They do not consider 
chromium to be one of those minerals for which a reliable clinical test is 
available(they don't like the hair and nail analysis labs either, and they 
also recognize the RBC chromium is primarily a research test that is not 
routinely available in most clinical chemistry labs).  This has to change 
and as more labs run a RBC chromiuum, it will.  What then do they suggest?
Make a diagnosis of chromium deficiency based on a documented clinical 
response to chromium(run a glucose tolerance test before and after chromium 
supplementation).  Once you make the diagnosis, put the patient on 200ug of 
CrCl3 orally each day or 10grams of yeast per day.

What's my advise?  Don't take chromium supplements to try to loose weight
(they just do not work that way).  If you want to take them and then 
exercise, that would be great.  Do include yeast as part of your diet(most 
Americans are not getting enough chromium from their diet).  If you do have 
a poor glucose tolerance, ask your doctor to check your chromium status.  
When he or she says, ""what in the world are you talking about"", just say, 
please get a copy of Weinsier and Morgan's new Clinical Nutrition textbook 
and do what they say to do with patients who present with a poor glucose 
tolerance.  If you can't do that, I'll find a doctor who can, thank you 
very much.

""There's no cure for stupidity of poll on doctors' salaries""

By Mike Royko
Tribune Media Services


     On a stupidity scale, a recent poll about doctors' earnings 
is right up there.  It almost scored a perfect brain-dead 10.
     It  was  commissioned by some whiny consumers  group  called 
Families USA.
      The  poll tells us that the majority of  Americans  believe 
that doctors make too much money.
     The  pollsters  also asked what a fair income would  be  for 
physicians.  Those polled said, oh, about $80,000 a year would be 
OK.
     How generous.  How sporting.  How stupid.
     Why is this poll stupid?   Because it is based on resentment 
and envy, two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign 
and are still simmering.
     You could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that 
earns $100,000-plus and get the same results.  Since the majority 
of Americans don't make those bucks,  they assume that those  who 
do are stealing it from them.
     Maybe  the Berlin Wall came down,  but don't  kid  yourself.  
Karl Marx lives.
     It's also stupid because it didn't ask key  questions,  such 
as:  Do  you  know how much education and training  it  takes  to 
become a physician?
     If those polled said no,  they didn't know, then they should 
have  been disqualified.   If they gave the wrong  answers,  they 
should have been dropped.   What good are their views on how much 
a doctor should earn if they don't know what it takes to become a 
doctor?
     Or maybe a question should have been phrased this way:  ""How 
much  should  a person earn if he or she must (a)  get  excellent 
grades and a fine educational foundation in high school in  order 
to (b) be accepted by a good college and spend four years  taking 
courses heavy in math, physics, chemistry, and other lab work and 
maintain a 3.5 average or better,  and (c) spend four more  years 
of  grinding study in medical school,  with the third and  fourth 
years in clinical training,  working 80 to 100 hours a week,  and 
(d) spend another year as a low-pay,  hard-work intern,  and  (e) 
put  in  another  three to 10 years  of  post-graduate  training, 
depending  on  your specialty and (f) maybe wind up  $100,000  in 
debt  after  medical school and (g) then work an  average  of  60 
hours  a week,  with many family doctors putting in 70  hours  or 
more until they retire or fall over?""
     As  you have probably guessed by now,  I  have  considerably 
more  respect for doctors than does the law firm of  Clinton  and 
Clinton,  and all the lawyers and insurance executives they  have 
called together to remake America's health care.
     Based  on what doctors contribute to society,  they are  far 
more useful than the power-happy,  ego-tripping, program-spewing, 
social tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is 
to health what Clinton's first budget is to frugality.
     But propaganda works.   And,  as the stupid poll  indicates, 
many Americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are  the 
major cause of high medical costs.
     Of  course doctors are well-compensated.   They  should  be.  
Americans now live longer than ever.   But who is responsible for 
our longevity--lawyers,  Congress, or the guy flipping burgers in 
a McDonald's?
     And the doctors prolong our lives despite our having  become 
a  nation  of  self-indulgent,   lard-butted,   TV-gaping   couch 
cabbages.
     Ah,  that  is not something you heard President  Clinton  or 
Super  Spouse  talk  about during the  campaign  or  since.   But 
instead of trying to turn the medical profession into a  villain, 
they might have been more honest if they had said:
     ""Let  us  talk  about medical care and one  of  the  biggest 
problems we have.   That problem is you, my fellow American. Yes, 
you,  eating  too much and eating the wrong foods;  many  of  you 
guzzling  too  much hooch;  still puffing away at $2.50  a  pack; 
getting  your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to  the 
microwave to the couch; doing dope and bringing crack babies into 
the  world;  filling  the big city emergency rooms  with  gunshot 
victims;  engaging  in unsafe sex and catching a  deadly  disease 
while blaming the world for not finding an instant cure.
     ""You  and  your habits,  not the  doctors,  are  the  single 
biggest  health  problem in this country.   If  anything,  it  is 
amazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do.
     ""In fact,  I don't understand how they can stand looking  at 
your blubbery bods all day.
     ""So as your president,  I call upon you to stop whining  and 
start living cleanly.   Now I must go get myself a triple cheesy-
greasy with double fries.  Do as I say, not as I do.""
     But  for those who truly believe that doctors are  overpaid, 
there is another solution: Don't use them.
     That's right.   You don't feel well?   Then try one of those 
spine poppers,  needle twirlers, or have Rev. Bubba lay his hands 
upon your head and declare you fit.
     Or  there is the do-it-yourself approach.   You  have  chest 
pains?   Then sit in front of a mirror,  make a slit here, a slit 
there, and pop in a couple of valves.
     You're  going to have a kid?   Why throw your money at  that 
overpaid  sawbones so he can buy a better car and a bigger  house 
than  you  will  ever  have  (while  paying  more  in  taxes  and 
malpractice insurance than you will ever earn)?
     Just have the kid the old-fashioned way.   Squat and do  it.  
And if it survives,  you can go to the library and find a book on 
how to give it its shots.
     By  the  way,  has  anyone  ever done a  poll  on  how  much 
pollsters should earn?

First off, use some decent terms if ya don't mind.  This is sci.med, not
alt.sex.

Secondly, how absolutely bogus to assume that ""American's are just too hung
up on the penis....blah,blah"".  I think most American's don't care about
anything so comlicated as that.  They just think it ""looks nicer"".  Ask 
a few of them and see what response you get.  Others still opt for
circumcision due to religious traditions and beliefs.  Some think it is
easier to clean.  Still others do it because ""Daddy was"".

Dont' be so naive as to think American's are afraid of sexuality. 

My son is not circumcised, and I can vouch for the argument that it is
more difficult to keep clean than a circumcised kids'.  Not so much that
the foreskin is difficult to pull back (it isn't) but because my son
doesn't want to wait long enough for a thorough check for smega or misplaced

The best thing to do is leave it, it will work its own way out to the surface.

Well, that post was not that accurate.  People with early life hernias
are felt to have a congenital sack that promotes the formation of hernias.
The hernias of later life may be more associated with chronic straining.  
However, the risk of damage to the intestine without an operation is 
high enough that it ought to be repaired.  The risk of cancer is probably
no higher than the general population, but since you are near 40, it would
be sensible to have some sort of cancer screening, such as a flexible
sigmoidoscopy.  Sorry for the misleading info.

Nntp-Posting-Host: vms.ocom.okstate.edu
Organization: OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine

I've sent Gordon R. my posts on protein, vitamin C and vitamin A prior to 
posting on internet as a professional courtesy.  Somehow I've managed to 
delete my vitamin A post from my text file.  Gordon R. had promised to send 
it back to me but he's pretty mad at me right now so I'll just retype it.
Since digging through all my references is very time consuming(took me all 
day for that PMS post), I'm not going to cite any references(Gordon R. has 
them).  I'm going to include some of the material from Weinsier and 
Morgan's new Nutrition textbook(which was not in my original material) to 
point out that what I'm going to say has some support in the medical 
community.

Diet has been know to affect the immune system of man for a very, very long 
time.  Protein has always had the biggest role in infection and I've 
already covered the role of protein in protecting you against infection.
Now I'm going to hit what I consider to be the most important nutrient in 
the U.S. as far as infection is concerned(vitamin A).

When vitamin A was originally discovered, it was commonly referred to as 
the anti-infection vitamin.  Many people(Linus Pauling being one) have 
decided to take this title away from vitamin A and give it to vitamin C
(which I've already covered).  Big mistake(in my opinion).  Vitamin A is 
also getting a reputation as an anti-cancer vitamin(with good reason).
The NCI currently has numerous clinical trials in progress to see if 
vitamin A can not only prevent cancer but cure it as well.  It's role in 
both cancer and infection is almost identical(but not quite).

Vitamin A comes in two completely different forms(retinol and 
beta-carotene).  Retinol is the animal form and it's toxic, beta-carotene 
is the plant form and it's completely nontoxic.  Both retinol and beta-
carotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile is present
(60-80%).  The liver stores all of your retinol and doles it out for other 
tissues to use by synthesizing retinol binding protein(RBP).  A normal human 
adult liver should have 500,000IU to 1,000,000IU of retinol stored.  We 
are born with 10,000IU in our liver.  U.S. autopsy has shown that about 
30% of Americans die with the same(or less) amount of vitamin A as they 
were born with.  If you don't believe that nutritional reserves(like that 
of retinol in the liver) are important, then this low vitamin A reserve is 
not going to affect you.  But if you believe(like I do) that the nutrient 
reserves are important, then there is a problem with vitamin A in the U.S.

The U.S. RDA for vitamin A in an adult male is 1,000 RE or 5,000IU of 
vitamin A.  For adult feamles its 800 RE or 4,000IU of vitamin A.  Diet 
surveys show that most Americans are getting this amount of vitamin A
(either retinol or Beta-carotene) from their diet.  But the NRC(National 
Research Council) was going to release a new RDA table in 1985 that had the 
RDA for both vitamin A and vitamin C raised(C to 90mg per day and A to 
7,500IU per day for adult males).  That report and it's recommendations was 
killed.  Why? Concern over the increasing supplementation was the main 
reason.  RDAs are set to prevent clinical disease, not to keep nutrient 
reserves full.  Many scientist in the U.S. feel that the time has come to 
move away from the prevention of clinical pathology concept and move 
towards the promotion of optimum health concept, especially since we have 
some very good data now that show that nutrient reserves are extremely 
important during periods of stress.  The nutritonal concervatives won that 
battle and a new group of scientist were collected to come out with the 
1989 RDA list which lowered the RDA for several nutrients and moved the 
dietary guidelines back to where they were when we first started in the 
1940's(get enough to prevent clinical pathology, but not enough to fill 
the reserves).

We know from autopsy that only about 10% of Americans have a liver with a 
normal vitamin A reserve(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU).  I preach nutrient 
reserves to my students and tell them to measure them in their patients.
But for vitamin A, only a liver biopsy(or autopsy data) will tell you how 
much somebody has stored.  We can tell very easily if someone has 
overfilled his or her liver with vitamin A by measuring the serium retinol 
level(levels above 450ug/dl are highly suggestive that you have filled your 
liver with vitamin A and it's time to stop taking retinol).  The normal 
range of serum retinol will be 20-100ug/dl.  Hypervitaminosis A is 
diagnosed with a serum retinol level of 2,000ug/dl or higher(Interpretation 
of Diagnostic Test, Wallach, M.D., a Little Brown Series book).  This level 
of vitamin A in blood means that medical attention is necessary due to 
vitamin A toxicity.  Weinsier and Morgan take a much more conservative 
approach to vitamin A toxicity than does Wallach, as you will see later in 
this post.  Between 450ug/dl and 2,000ug/dl you should have plenty 
of warning that it's time to eliminate the retinol from your diet(headache, 
redness of the skin, hair loss, joint pain).

I tell all my students that will use vitamin A in their practice that they 
had better monitor the serum retinol level and stop when there are clear 
signs that the liver is full.  You will never really know if the patient 
needs the vitamin A(because you can not measure the pool in liver) but you 
will always know when it's time to stop(just like in those vitamin A for 
PMS studies).

Beta-carotene can be taken to fill up your liver with retinol and you will 
never have to worry about toxicity because the conversion of beta-carotene to 
retinol that occurs in both your gut and your liver will slow down(stops in the 
liver and slows down in the gut) when your liver is full of retinol.  But 
taking Beta-carotene as the source of retinol takes a very long time to 
fill the liver up(I've seen estimates of 20-30 years) if you are in the 30% 
that only has as much as you were born with in your liver(10,000IU).  One 
other problem with beta-carotene, if you have a zinc deficit, you will not 
convert as much beta-carotene to retinol in the gut or the liver because the 
enxzyme that does this conversion requires zinc.  In addition, the release of 
retinol from the liver is a zinc dependent process so a zinc deficit will 
cause a vitamin A deficit even if your liver has plenty of vitamin A.

Now what does vitamin A do in cancer and infection protection?  The body 
uses vitamin A(retinol) for many different things.  Vision(the first to be 
nailed down and where you see overt clinical pathology) uses the aldehyde
(retinal) and alcohol(retinol) form of vitamin A.  Reproduction uses the 
retinol form  and some retinal.  Infection and cancer protection uses 
retinoic acid.  How do you convert retinol(which your white blood cells 
and the mucosal cells get from blood) to retinoic acid?  You use enzymes, 
one of which requires vitamin C(this is why Pauling has tried to pull the 
title of anti-infection vitamin away from vitamin A).  Vitamin C does play 
a role in infection(interferon production for example) but it's biggest role 
is the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid.  If you increase your intake 
of vitamin C, you will increase your formation of retinoic acid.  But 
retinoic acid can not be converted back to retinol(as retinal can) and once 
it's formed, it's used and then lost to the body.  This is why the 1985 NRC 
group wanted to increase both vitamin C and vitamin A RDA's.

Most people taking large amounts of vitamin C really think that they are 
helping themselves.  If they don't have much vitamin A in their liver and 
they are not also increasing their intake of vitamin A, they actually do 
themselves more harm than good.

Retinoic acid functions in white blood cells to promote antibody formation.
In the mucus membrane, it is the main factor in promoting good mucus 
production and a good epithelial cell barrier to prevent infectious agents from 
entering the blood system.  The mucus membrane is referred to as the ""first 
line"" defense against infection.  For cancer, retinoic acid has been shown 
to act as a cell brake(it counteracts the effect of cell promoters which 
stimulate cells to divide).  Cancer has two distinct steps, DNA alteration 
and cell promotion.  For cells that normally divide all the time, promoters 
are not that important.  But for lung and breast tissue which does not 
normally divide, promoters are real important in the malignant process.
This is the major reason why the NCI has so many different clinical trials 
in progress using retinol and/or beta-carotene.

Chronic infection(irritation) of the mucus membranes is a signal that 
vitamin A may not be adequate.  I tell my students that any patient who 
walks into their office with a complaint of chronic infection has to be 
worked up for vitamin A(along with the other factors that medicine already 
has on it's list of causes for chronic infection).  I drive this home in my 
course at the Osteopathic College in Tulsa, when I teach at the allopathic 
medical school in Tulsa(OU's branch campus) and when I give CME lectures.

Dark adaptation is the best clinical test for vitamin A status since night 
vision is impacted when liver reverves drop to 50,000IU of retinol.  The 
serum level of retinol can also be used, but it does not drop until liver 
reserves drop below 10,000 to 20,000IU.  Asking a patient if they have 
trouble seeing at night is a good initial screen(if cataracts are ruled 
out).  In one study done on U.S. Spanish-Americans where serum retinol levels 
were measured, 25% of the sample population had a serum retinol level below 
20ug/dl.

As more studies are done on serum retinol levels in population groups of 
the U.S. that have had a history of high infection rates, we will probably 
see a much stonger correlation between infection incidence rates and low 
serum retinol levels.

What do Weinsier and Morgan have to say about vitamin A?  Here are excerpts
from their book:

Vitamin A functions in vision in the forrm of retinol, it is necessay for 
growth and differentation of epithelial tissue, and is required for 
reproduction, embryonic development, and bone growth.  Protein-calorie 
malnutrition and zinc deficiency may impair the absorption, transport, and 
metabolism of vitamin A.  Retinaldehyde is converted to retinoic acid, 
which has biological activity in growth and in cell diferentiation but not 
in reproduction or vision.  The most common procedure to evaluate vitamin A 
status is to measure the retinol level in plasma or serum.  The normal 
range for vitamin A content for a child is 20 to 90ug/dl.  Lower values are 
indicators of deficiency or depleted body stores.  Serum levels greater 
than 100ug/dl are indicative of toxic levels of vitamin A.  Dark adaptation 
tests and electroretinogram measurements are also useful but difficult to 
perform on young children.  Rapidly proliferating tissues are sensitive to 
vitamin A deficiency and may revert to an undifferentiated state.  The 
bronchorespiratory tract, skin, genitourinary system, gastrointestinal 
tract and sweat glands are adversely affected.  A daily intake of more than 
7.5mg(about 37,000IU) of retinol is not advised and chronic use of amounts 
over 20mg(100,000IU) can result in a dry and itching skin, desquamation, 
erythematous dermatitis, hair loss, joint pain, chapped lips, hyperostois
(bony depositis), headaches, anorexia, edema and fatigue.  

They recommend 30mg of retinol via IM injection in children for vitamin A 
deficiency but do not discuss treatment for adults.  Their toxic serum retinol 
level is very conservative.  I recommend that my students try 25,000IU in 
adults that are having problems with chronic infection.  They have to rule 
out a zinc deficit first by getting an RBC zinc run(or if their clinical 
lab can't run it, I tell them to do what Weinsier and Morgan suggest, give 
them the zinc along with the vitamin A.  At 25,000IU per day, toxicity 
should not be a problem and you will not have to worry about pulling the 
patient into the office on a regular basis to run a serum retinol.

Both Elaine and Jon found doctors who used a much higher dose of vitamin A.
Recall that the PMS papers were using 100,000IU to 200,000IU of vitamin A.
I don't suggest that my students use these high doses.  If you wanted to 
fill the liver up fast(as part of a clinical trial) and were monitoring the 
serum retinol level, then you would be okay.  But my knowledge of the 
vitamin A literature suggests to me that 25,000IU for patients with a 
demonstrated vitamin A deficit(dark adapatation test or serum retinol) will 
provide a good and steady improvement(as long as zinc and vitamin C status 
are good) without having to worry about toxicity.  If they want to get more 
agressive, fine if they follow my advise to check the serum retinol.  But 
vitamin A(retinol) should never be given in high dose to women who could 
become pregnant since vitamin A shows teratogenicity towards the human 
fetus.  The dose needed to show this effect on the developing fetus is 
18,000IU of retinol per day.  Beta-carotene will never have this effect on 
the human fetus.

Could just taking Beta-carotene instead of retinol supplements help?  Yes 
but the effect will take a long time to develop.  My advise is to use 
retinol to fill the liver up and then switch to beta-carotene to keep it 
full.  Vitamin A is probably one nutrient that is better off left to 
prescription by doctors.  But when we have the M.D.'s in this newsgroup 
jumping all over me and other doctors that propose the use of vitamin A 
supplements for treating patients with chronic sinus and GI distress, I 
think that the most prudent option is to keep vitamin A in the OTC market 
but require manufactors to provide package inserts to educate the general 
public about the dangers of vitamin A supplementation.

Subject: Seeking info on retinal detachment
Organization: Acadia University
Lines: 40

I am quite near sighted.

I've recently received laser treatment for both eyes to seal
holes in the retinas to help prevent retinal detachment. In my
left eye a small detachment had begun already and apparently the
laser was used to ""weld"" this back in place as well.

My right eye seems fine. In my left eye I was seeing occasional
flashes of bright light prior to the treatment. Since the
treatment (two weeks) these flashes are now occuring more often
- several each hour.

The opthamologist explained the flashes are caused because the
vitreous body has attached to the retina and is pulling on it. He
says this is not treatable and he hopes it may go away on its own
accord - if it tugs enough I may well face retinal detachment.

I am seeking (via sci.med) additional info on retinal detachments.
The Dr. did not wish to spend much time with me in explanations
so I appreciate any further details anyone can provide. Of most
interest to me:

If my retina does detach what should be my immediate course
of action?

If conventional surgery is need to repair the detachment what is
the procedure like and what kind of vision can I expect
afterwards.

Do the symptoms (fairly frequent flashes) imply that detachment
maybe near at hand or is this not necessarily cause for alarm.

Many thanks

Claude, I've not heard or read anything that would suggest that vitamin A(
retinol) could reverse hearing loss due to nerve damage(usually caused by 
high sound levels, but also occassionally due to severe infection).  The 
types of cells that vitamin A regulates are the general epithelial cells 
and these cell types are not the ones that function in the ear hearing 
process.  The hair cell nerve-like epithelial cells in the ear may respond 
to vitamin A during cellular differentiation(embryogenesis) but I don't 
know if they are still capable of responding in adults.  If they are 
capable of responding with new hair growth, this would be a very major 
breakthrough in hearing loss.  With all of the medical interest in vitamin 
A, it would not be too surprising if a clinical study was done using 
vitamin A to reverse hearing loss.  But with only a news announcement to go 
on(and this type of communication is notoriously bad), I can't comment on 
your question anymore than I already have.  If one study has been done, 
more will need to follow to firm up a link between vitamin A and hearing 
loss if there really is one.

Perhaps the listlessness caused by thyroid deficiency could mimic
depression, or feeling unable to do anything could cause one to get
depressed, but I know of no specific effect on the brain caused by the
thyroid that would cause depression. Note that weight gain is usually
a symptom of both. Simple blood tests would indicate if a thyroid
condition is present.

I don't know if depression would cause a reduction in thyroid output,
but I would tend to doubt it. As far as I know clinical depression is
caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain, and that chemical
imbalance has no direct effect on any other part of the body. A regular
everyday depression IMHO should not cause a chemical imbalance in the
body at all.

The pituitary bases its secretions of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)
on the level of circulating Thyroxin (there are two types T3 and T4 -
one is used as a reserve and is changed into the other -active- form in
the liver). The ratio of T3 & T4 can be affected by a number of other
hormones (estrogen, for example). Naturally, changing activity of the
body's cells would cause changes in availabilty of free thyroxin, but
the liver and a healthy thyroid should be able to balance things out in
short order.

Good sources for info on the thyroid are the Merk Manual (a physician's
reference book ) although reading it is enough to get one depressed :-)
and the Encyclopedia Brittanica (should be available in your local
library).

I hope this has been of some help.

   Any opinions on Burzynski's antineoplastons or information about the current 
   status of his research would be appreciated.

Burzynski's work is not too promising. None of his A-1 through A-5
antineoplastons have been shown to have antineoplastic effects against
experimental cancer. The NCI conducted tests of A-2 and A-5 against
leukemia in mice, with the result that doses high enough to produce
toxic effects in the mice were not effective in inhibiting the growth
of the tumor or killing it. (These were in 1983 and 1985)

Burzynski claims that A-10 is the active factor common to all of A-1
and A-5 (something which he has not shown, A-10 has only been
extracted from A-2. He also hasn't shown that A-1 through A-5 are actually
distinct substances). The NCI conducted a series of tests using A-10
against a standard panel of tumors that included different cell lines
from tumors in the following classes: leukemia, non-small-cell and
small-cell lung cancer, colon cancer, cancer of the central nervous
system, melanoma, ovarian cancer and renal cancer. A-10 exhibited
neither growth inhibition nor cytotoxicity at the dose levels tested.

It is necessary to process A-10 since it is not soluble (Burzynski's
theory requires soluble agents), but this basically hydrolizes it to
PAG (which he calls AS 2.5). PAG is not an information carrying
peptide, something which Byrzynski claims is necessary for
antineoplastic activity. AS 2.1 (also derived from A-10) is a 4:1
mixture of PA and PAG. PA (also not a peptide) can be purchased at a
chemical supply houses for about $0.09 a gram. A-10 is chemically
extremely similar to glutithamide and thalidomide, both of which are
habit forming and can cause peripheral neuropathy. The nasty effects
of thalidomide are widely known. In spite of this similarity, A-10
does not appear to have been tested for it's potential to induce
teratogenicity or peripheral neuropathy.

Many of Burzynski's statements about the origin of his theory, early
research, past and present support by others for his work have been
shown to be untrue.

Its bogus.  See the sci.skeptic FAQ (I edit it).

You can diagnose some things by looking at the eyes.  Glaucoma is the
Classic Example, but there are probably others.

Iridology maps parts of the body onto the irises of the eyes.  By
looking at the patterns, striations and occasional blobs in the irises
you are supposed to be able to diagnose illnesses all over the body.

The two questions to ask any alternative therapist are:

1: How does it work?

2: What evidence is there?

The answer to question 1 takes a little knowledge of medicine to
evaluate.  I don't know about iridology, but I've read a book on
reflexology, which is a remarkably similar notion except that the
organs of the body are mapped onto the soles of the feet.  There are
supposed to be channels running down the body carrying information or
energy of some sort.  Anatomists have found no such structures.
(Always beware the words ""channel"" and ""energy"" in any spiel put out
by an alternative practitioner.)

The answer to question 2 is rather simpler.  If all they have is
anecdotal evidence then forget it.  Ask for referreed papers in
mainstream medical journals.  Ignore any bull about the conspiracy of
rich doctors suppressing alternative practitioners.  Studies are done
and papers are published.  Some of them are even positive.

The word ""licensed"" in the flyer is an interesting one.  Licensed by
whom?  For what?  It is quite possible that the herbology is real and
requires a license: you can kill someone by giving them the wrong
plants to eat, and many plants contain very powerful drugs (Foxglove
and Willow spring to mind).  It is not clear whether the license
extends to the iridology, and I suspect that if you ask you will be
told that it means ""(Licensed herbologist) and iridologist"".

BTW, the usual term is ""herbalist"".  Why use a different word?

the patient has HbSag in his/her blood and can transmit the infection, but

I've got a very nice collection of historical books on medical quackery,
and on the topic of massage this is a recurring theme.  Ordinary massage
is intended to make a person feel better, especially if they have muscular
or joint problems.  But -- like chiropracty -- there are some practitioners
who take the technique to a far extreme, invoking what seems to me to be
quack science to justify their technique.

In the case of massage, there is a technique called ""deep abdominal massage""
in which the masseur is literally attempting to massage the intestines!
The notion is that undigested food adheres to the inner surface of the
intestines and putrifies, releasing poisons which cause various disease
syndromes.  By this vigorous and painful procedure, it is alleged that
these deposits can be loosened up and passed out.

I just can't believe this idea has any truth behind it!  The human intestine
is not a New York City sewer pipe!  And even if it were, you eat half of
a small box of Triscuits, and there ain't gonna be nothin' sticking to the
inner surface of your intestine  :-)

I am reluctant to summarize it, for then you will have my opinion of what the

for you to take the trouble to go to the library and get the article.  The
title is ""The shot doctors"" and it appears on Pages 96-100 of the February,
1988 issue of Consumer Reports.  The following excerpt from the article may
entice you to read the whole article:

Our 20-month son has started falling sick quite often every since he
started going to day care.  He was at home for the first year and he did
not fall sick even once.  Now it seems like he has some sort of cold or
flu pretty much once a month.  Most of the time the cold leads to an ear
infection as well, with the result that he ends up being on antibiotics
3 weeks out of 4.  I know kids in day care fall sick more often, but we
are beginning to wonder how often ""more often"" really is, whether our
son is more susceptible or has lower immunity than average, what the
longer-term effects of constantly being sick and taking antibiotics are,
and what we can do to build up his resistance.  He really enjoys his day
care and we think it's great too, but we are beginning to wonder whether
we should think about getting a nanny.

Are there any studies that can help answer some of these questions?

-- How often do kids in their first, second and third years fall sick?
How often do they get colds, flus, ear infections?  Is there any data on
home care vs. day care?

-- Does being sick ""build immunity"" (leading to less illness later),
does it make kids ""weaker"" (leading to more illness later), or does it
not have any long term effect?

-- Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long
term effects?

-- How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than
normal, and what does one do about it?

-- Is there any way to build immunity and resistance?

Any data, information or advice relating to this would be much

It seems to me you've offered a circular refutation of Moss's organization. Who
has shown the information in the latest book of PAC to be questionable? Could
it be those 'regulatory' agencies and medical industries which Moss is showing
to be operating with *major* vested interests. Whether one believes that these
vested interests are real or not, or whether or not they actually shape medical
research is a seperate argument. If one sees a possibility, however, that these
interests exist, then the 'fact' that some of the information put out by PAC
has been refuted by the medical industry doesn't hold much weight.

As for the ineffectiveness of antineoplasteons, the fact that the NIH didn't
find them effective doesn't make much sense here. Of course they didn't! I
tend to have more faith in the word of the patients who are now alive after
being told years ago that they would be dead of cancer soon. They are fighting
like hell to keep that clinic open, and they credit his treatment with their
survival. Anyone who looks at the NIH's record for investigation of 'alterna-
tive' cancer therapies will easily see that they have a strange knack for find-
ing relatively cheap and nontoxic therapies dangerous or useless.

Sounds pretty familiar.  I posted similar cries about last September when
Caroline just entered daycare.  She was two, then, and have been with 
continuous colds since until last March.  As spring approaches, her colds
slowed down.  Meanwhile we grew more and more relaxed about her colds.
Only once did the doctor diagnosed an ear infection and only twice she
had antibiotics.  (The other time was due to sinus infection, and I wished
that I did not give her that awful Septra.) 

>Are there any studies that can help answer some of these questions?

There are the 'net studies' -- that is, if you read this newsgroup often,
there will be a round of questions like this every month.  There might
be formal studies like that, but bear with my not so academic experience.
Okay?

Gee, I bet 50/50 you'll hear cases in all these catagories.

I am pretty sure, an insulated child at home sicks less.  But, that child 
still will face the world one day.

That's what I believe and comfort myself with.  Caroline will get more
and more colds for sure before she learned not to stick her hand in other 
kid's mouth nor let other kids do the same.  Cold virus mutate easily.
However, I hope that her immune system will be stronger to fight these
diseases, so she would be less severely affected.  Everytime she has a cold,
we make sure she blow her nose frequently and give her Dorcol or Dimetapp 
at night so she can have good rest (thanks to some suggestions from the net).
That's about all the care she needs from us.  I try very hard to keep her
off antibiotics.  Twice her ped. gave me choice to decide whether she would
have antibiotics.  I waited just long enough (3-4 days) to see that she
fought the illness off.  I do understand that you don't have much choice if
the child is in pain and/or high fever. 

>does it make kids ""weaker"" (leading to more illness later), or does it

If the child doesn't rely on antibiotics to fight off the sickness everytime,
then the child should be stronger.

I'll leave this to expert.

If your child just entered daycare, I'm pretty sure the first 6 months will be
the hardest.  (Then, you get more used to it.  Boy, do I hate to see me typing
this sentence.  I recall when I read something like this last September, I said 
to myself, 'oh, sure.'  But, I do get used to it, now.)  However, I do hear 
people say that it does get better after a year or two.  I am looking forward 
to a healthier next winter.  As it gets warmer, I hope you do get some break 
soon.

>-- Is there any way to build immunity and resistance?

That is the standard advice in dermatology texts.
The soak part greatly increases the inconvenience.  Don't bother unless
it doesn't work otherwise.

Exactly, but it adds to the ""ritual"" aspect, which is important for
us suggestible patients.  (Posters, don't bother to repeat the 
rationale for the soak.)

Greasy no matter what. Vaseline (generically, petrolatum) is 
famous for that.  One text states that the more greasy a dry-skin
cream is, the more effective.

Try USP lanolin, at least for maintenance (preventive) therapy.  USP
lanolin is natural and much less greasy AND cheap (don't buy the more
expensive perfumed lanolin mixture).  As I've commented before, petrolatum
is a poorly characterized mixture of hydrocarbons which are not found in
biological systems (that is not inherently bad, but smell it up close,
even on your hand), are partially absorbed into the body and remain there
for months or more, and have associations with cancer.  Don't panic, but
also don't believe it's God's gift to the human skin.

Last week I went to see a gastroenterologist. I had never met this
doctor before, and she did not know what I was there for. As soon as I
arrived, somebody showed me to an examining room and handed me a gown.
They told me to undress (from the waist down, to be exact) and wait for the
doctor. Is this the usual drill when you go to a doctor for the first
time? I don't have much experience going to doctors (knock on wood), but
on the couple of occasions when I've gone to a new doctor, I met him
with my clothes on. First, he introduced himself, asked what I was there
for and took a history, all before I undressed.
 
Are patients usually expected to get naked before meeting a doctor
for the first time? Personally, I'd prefer to meet the doctor on
something remotely resembling a condition of parity and to establish an
identity as a person who wears clothes before dropping my drawers. If
nothing else, it minimizes the time that I have to spend in the self
conscious, ill at ease and vulnerable condition of a person with a bare
bottom talking to somebody who is fully clothed.
 
Does anybody besides me regard this get-naked-first-and-then-we-can-talk
attitude as insensitive? Also, is it unusual?

I just went back to the chapter in Cecil on chronic hepatitis.  It seems
that indeed most cases of CPH are persistant viral hepatitis, whereas
there are a multitude of potential and probable causes for CAH (viral,
drugs, alcohol, autoimmune, etc.).  Physicians seem to have a variety of
""thresholds"" for electing to biopsy someone's liver.  Personally, I think
that if the patient is asymptomatic, with only slight transaminitis and
normal albumin and PT, one can simply follow them closely and not add the

providing these samples for study.  It would be interesting to see if
anyone's done any decision analysis on this.

I've seen people in their forties and fifties become disoriented and
demented during hospital stays. In the examples I've seen, drugs were
definitely involved. 

My own father turned into a vegetable for a short time while in the
hospital. He was fifty-three at the time, and he was on 21 separate
medications. The family protested, but the doctors were adamant, telling
us that none of the drugs interact. They even took the attitude that, if
he was disoriented, they should put him on something else as well! With
the help of an MD friend of the family, we had all his medication
discontinued. He had a seizure that night, and was put back on one drug.
Two days later, he was his old self again. I guess there aren't many
medical texts that address the subject of 21-way interactions.

I don't mean this as a cheap shot at the medical profession. It is an
aspect of hospitals that is very frightening to me. Docs seem to believe
that, because they have close control of you, it's quite all right to
take your bodily equilibria into their own hands. That control reduces
the chance that the patient will make a mistake, but health care
providers can make mistakes too, and mistakes can be deadly under those
circumstances. 

I grant you that sometimes there's no choice. Nevertheless, I suggest
you procure a list of the drugs your grandmother is getting, and discuss
it with an independent doc. Her problems may not be the effect of HALDOL
at all. HALDOL may have been used validly, or it may have been
prescribed because OTHER medication confused her, and because the
hospital normally prescribes HALDOL for the confused elderly.

Just my opinion,

               Rates of Cesarean Delivery -- United States, 1991
               =================================================
                   SOURCE: MMWR 42(15)   DATE: Apr 23, 1993

     Cesarean deliveries have accounted for nearly 1 million of the 
approximately 4 million annual deliveries in the United States since 1986 
(Table 1). The cesarean rate in the United States is the third highest among 
21 reporting countries, exceeded only by Brazil and Puerto Rico (1). This 
report presents data on cesarean deliveries from CDC's National Hospital 
Discharge Survey (NHDS) for 1991 and compares these data with previous years. 
     Data on discharges from short-stay, nonfederal hospitals have been 
collected annually since 1965 in the NHDS, conducted by CDC's National Center 
for Health Statistics. For 1991, medical and demographic information were 
abstracted from a sample of 274,000 inpatients discharged from 484 
participating hospitals. The 1991 cesareans and vaginal births after a prior 
cesarean (VBAC) presented in this report are based on weighted national 
estimates from the NHDS sample of approximately 31,000 (11%) women discharged 
after delivery. The estimated numbers of live births by type of delivery were 
calculated by applying cesarean rates from the NHDS to live births from 
national vital registration data. Therefore, estimates of the number of 
cesareans in this report will not agree with previously published data based 
solely on the NHDS (2). Stated differences in this analysis are significant at 
the 95% confidence level, based on the two-tailed t-test with a critical value 
of 1.96. 
     In 1991, there were 23.5 cesareans per 100 deliveries, the same rate as 
in 1990 and similar to rates during 1986-1989 (Table 1). The primary cesarean 
rate (i.e., number of first cesareans per 100 deliveries to women who had no 
previous cesareans) for 1986-1991 also was stable, ranging from 16.8 to 17.5. 
In 1991, the cesarean rate in the South was 27.6, significantly (p<0.05) 
higher than the rates for the West (19.8), Midwest (21.8), and Northeast 
(22.6). Rates were higher for mothers aged greater than or equal to 30 years 
than for younger women; in proprietary hospitals than in nonprofit or 
government hospitals; in hospitals with fewer than 300 beds than in larger 
hospitals; and for deliveries for which Blue Cross/Blue Shield * and other 
private insurance is the expected source of payment than for other sources of 
payment (Table 2). The same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries. 
     Since the early 1970s, the number and percentage of births to older women 
increased; however, if the age distribution of mothers in 1991 had remained 
the same as in 1986, the overall cesarean rate in 1991 would have been 23.3, 
essentially the same as the 23.5 observed. 
     Based on the NHDS, of the approximately 4,111,000 live births in 1991, an 

HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  1
Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993

estimated 966,000 (23.5%) were by cesarean delivery. Of these, an estimated 
338,000 (35.0%) births were repeat cesareans, and 628,000 (65.0%) were primary 
cesareans. Since 1986, approximately 600,000 primary cesareans have been 
performed annually. In 1986, 8.5% of women who had a previous cesarean 
delivered vaginally, compared with 24.2% in 1991. Of all cesareans in 1991, 
35.0% were associated with a previous cesarean, 30.4% with dystocia (i.e., 
failure of labor to progress), 11.7% with breech presentation, 9.2% with fetal 
distress, and 13.7% with all other specified complications. 
     The average hospital stay for all deliveries in 1991 was 2.8 days. In 
comparison, the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was 4.5 days, 
and for a repeat cesarean, 4.2 days -- nearly twice the duration for VBAC 
deliveries (2.2 days) or for vaginal deliveries that were not VBACs (2.3 
days). In 1986, the average hospital stay for all deliveries was 3.2 days, for 
primary cesareans 5.2 days, for repeat cesareans 4.7 days, and for VBAC and 
non-VBAC vaginal deliveries 2.7 and 2.6 days, respectively. 

Reported by: Office of Vital and Health Statistics Systems, National Center 
for Health Statistics, CDC. 

Editorial Note: The cesarean rate in the United States steadily increased from 
1965 through 1986; however, the findings in this report indicate that rates 
have been stable since 1986 (3). Because there is little evidence that 
maternal and child health status has improved during this time and because 
cesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications of 
childbirth, a national health objective for the year 2000 (4) is to reduce the 
overall cesarean rate to 15 or fewer per 100 deliveries and the primary 
cesarean rate to 12 or fewer per 100 deliveries (objective 14.8). 
     Postpartum complications -- including urinary tract and wound infections 
-- may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries 
than for vaginal births (5). Moreover, the prolonged hospital stays for 
cesarean deliveries substantially increase health-care costs. For example, in 
1991, the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were $7826 and 
$4720, respectively. The additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes 
$611 for physician fees and $2495 for hospital charges (6). If the cesarean 
rate in 1991 had been 15 (the year 2000 objective) instead of 23.5, the number 
of cesarean births would have decreased by 349,000 (617,000 versus 966,000), 
resulting in a savings of more than $1 billion in physician fees and hospital 
charges. 
     Despite the steady increase in VBAC rates since 1986, several factors may 
impede progress toward the year 2000 national health objectives for cesarean 
delivery. For example, VBAC rates substantially reflect the number of women 
offered trial of labor, which has been increasingly encouraged since 1982 (7). 
Of women who are offered a trial of labor, 50%-70% could deliver vaginally (7) 
--a level already achieved by many hospitals (8). Trial of labor was routinely 
offered in 46% of hospitals surveyed in 1984 (the most recent year for which 

HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  2
Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993

national data are available) (9) when the VBAC rate (according to NHDS data) 
was 5.7%. The year 2000 objective specifies a VBAC rate of 35%, based on all 
women who had a prior cesarean, regardless of whether a trial of labor was 
attempted. To reach the overall cesarean rate goal, however, increases in the 
VBAC rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primary 
rate. 
     One hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery by 
applying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean 
delivery, by requiring a second opinion, and by instituting a peer-review 
process (10). Other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery rates 
include eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizing 
reimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries; public dissemination of 
physician- and hospital-specific cesarean delivery rates to increase public 
awareness of differences in practices; and addressing malpractice concerns, 
which may be an important factor in maintaining the high rates of cesarean 
delivery (4).

         Malaria Among U.S. Embassy Personnel -- Kampala, Uganda, 1992
         =============================================================
                   SOURCE: MMWR 42(15)   DATE: Apr 23, 1993

     The treatment and prevention of malaria in Africa has become a 
challenging and complex problem because of increasing drug resistance. 
Although the risk of acquiring malaria for U.S. citizens and their dependents 
stationed overseas generally has been low, this risk varies substantially and 
unpredictably. During May 1992, the Office of Medical Services, Department of 
State (OMS/DOS), and CDC were notified of an increased number of malaria cases 
among official U.S. personnel stationed in Kampala, Uganda. A review of the 
health records from the Embassy Health Unit (EHU) in Kampala indicated that 27 
cases of malaria were diagnosed in official personnel from March through June 
1992 compared with two cases during the same period in 1991. EHU, OMS/DOS, and 
CDC conducted an investigation to confirm all reported malaria cases and 
identify potential risk factors for malaria among U.S. Embassy personnel. This 
report summarizes the results of the investigation. 
     Malaria blood smears from 25 of the 27 reported case-patients were 
available for review by OMS/DOS and CDC. A case of malaria was confirmed if 
the slide was positive for Plasmodium sp. Of the 25 persons, 17 were slide-
confirmed as having malaria. 
     A questionnaire was distributed to all persons served by the EHU to 
obtain information about residence, activities, use of malaria 
chemoprophylaxis, and use of personal protection measures (i.e., using bednets 
and insect repellents, having window and door screens, and wearing long 
sleeves and pants in the evening). Of the 157 persons eligible for the survey, 
128 (82%) responded. 
     Risk for malaria was not associated with sex or location of residence in 
Kampala. Although the risk for malaria was higher among children aged less 
than or equal to 15 years (6/32 19%) than among persons greater than 15 
years (11/94 12%), this difference was not significant (relative risk 
RR=1.6; 95% confidence interval CI=0.6-4.0). Eighty-two percent of the 
cases occurred among persons who had been living in Kampala for 1-5 years, 
compared with those living there less than 1 year. Travel outside of the 
Kampala area to more rural settings was not associated with increased risk for 
malaria. 
     Four malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens were used by persons who 
participated in the survey: mefloquine, chloroquine and proguanil, chloroquine 
alone, and proguanil alone. In addition, 23 (18%) persons who responded were 
not using any malaria chemoprophylaxis. The risk for malaria was significantly 
lower among persons using either mefloquine or chloroquine and proguanil (8/88 
9%) than among persons using the other regimens or no prophylaxis (9/37 
24%) (RR=0.4; 95% CI=0.2-0.9). Twelve persons not using prophylaxis reported 
side effects or fear of possible side effects as a reason. 
     The risk for malaria was lower among persons who reported using bednets

all or most of the time (2/27 7%) than among persons who sometimes or rarely 
used bednets (15/99 15%) (RR=0.5; 95% CI=0.1-2.0). The risk for malaria was 
also lower among persons who consistently used insect repellent in the evening 
(0/16), compared with those who rarely used repellent (17/110 15%) (RR=0; 
upper 95% confidence limit=1.2). Risk for malaria was not associated with 
failure to have window or door screens or wear long sleeves or pants in the 
evening. 
     As a result of this investigation, EHU staff reviewed with all personnel 
the need to use and comply with the recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis 
regimens. EHU staff also emphasized the need to use personal protection 
measures and made plans to obtain insecticide-impregnated bednets and to 
provide window and door screens for all personnel.

Editorial Note: In Uganda, the increase in malaria among U.S. personnel was 
attributed to poor adherence to both recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis 
regimens and use of personal protection measures during a period of increased 
malaria transmission and intensified chloroquine resistance in sub-Saharan 
Africa. The findings in this report underscore the need to provide initial and 
continued counseling regarding malaria prevention for persons living abroad in 
malaria-endemic areas -- preventive measures that are also important for 
short-term travelers to such areas. 
     Mefloquine is an effective prophylaxis regimen in Africa and in most 
other areas with chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum; however, in some areas 
(e.g., Thailand), resistance to mefloquine may limit its effectiveness. In 
Africa, the efficacy of mefloquine, compared with chloroquine alone, in 
preventing infection with P. falciparum is 92% (1 ). Mefloquine is safe and 
well tolerated when given at 250 mg per week over a 2-year period. The risk 
for serious adverse reactions possibly associated with mefloquine prophylaxis 
(e.g., psychosis and convulsions) is low (i.e., 1.3-1.9 episodes per 100,000 
users 2), while the risk for less severe adverse reactions (e.g., dizziness, 
gastrointestinal complaints, and sleep disturbances) is similar to that for 
other antimalarial chemoprophylactics (1). 
     Doxycycline has similar prophylactic efficacy to mefloquine, but the need 
for daily dosing may reduce compliance with and effectiveness of this regimen 
(3,4). Chloroquine alone is not effective as prophylaxis in areas of intense 
chloroquine resistance (e.g., Southeast Asia and Africa). In Africa, for 
persons who cannot take mefloquine or doxycycline, chloroquine and proguanil 
is an alternative, although less effective, regimen. Chloroquine should be 
used for malaria prevention in areas only where chloroquine-resistant P. 
falciparum has not been reported.

      FDA Approval of Use of a New Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine and a
       Combined Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis and Haemophilus b Conjugate
                       Vaccine for Infants and Children
      ==================================================================
                   SOURCE: MMWR 42(15)   DATE: Apr 23, 1993

     Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccines have been 
recommended for use in infants since 1990, and their routine use in infant 
vaccination has contributed to the substantial decline in the incidence of Hib 
disease in the United States (1-3). Vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, and 
pertussis during infancy and childhood have been administered routinely in the 
United States since the late 1940s and has been associated with a greater than 
90% reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with infection by these 
organisms. Because of the increasing number of vaccines now routinely 
recommended for infants, a high priority is the development of combined 
vaccines that allow simultaneous administration with fewer separate 
injections. 
     The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently licensed two new products 
for vaccinating children against these diseases: 1) the Haemophilus b 
conjugate vaccine (tetanus toxoid conjugate, ActHIB Trademark), * for 
vaccination against Hib disease only and 2) a combined diphtheria and tetanus 
toxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Hib conjugate vaccine 
(TETRAMUNE Trademark), a combination of vaccines formulated for use in 
vaccinating children against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and Hib disease. 

                               ActHIB Trademark 

     On March 30, 1993, the FDA approved a new Haemophilus b conjugate 
vaccine, polyribosylribitol phosphate-tetanus toxoid conjugate (PRP-T), 
manufactured by Pasteur Merieux Serum et Vaccins and distributed as ActHIB 
Trademark by Connaught Laboratories, Inc. (Swiftwater, Pennsylvania). This 
vaccine has been licensed for use in infants in a three-dose primary 
vaccination series administered at ages 2, 4, and 6 months. Previously 
unvaccinated infants 7-11 months of age should receive two doses 2 months 
apart. Previously unvaccinated children 12-14 months of age should receive one 
dose. A booster dose administered at 15 months of age is recommended for all 
children. Previously unvaccinated children 15-59 months of age should receive 
a single dose and do not require a booster. More than 90% of infants receiving 
a primary vaccination series of ActHIB Trademark (consecutive doses at 2, 4, 
and 6 months of age) develop a geometric mean titer of anti-Haemophilus b 
polysaccharide antibody greater than 1 ug/mL (4). This response is similar to 
that of infants who receive recommended series of previously licensed 
Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines for which efficacy has been demonstrated in 
prospective trials. Two U.S. efficacy trials of PRP-T were terminated early 
because of the concomitant licensure of other Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines 

HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  8

for use in infants (4). In these studies, no cases of invasive Hib disease 
were detected in approximately 6000 infants vaccinated with PRP-T. These and 
other studies suggest that the efficacy of PRP-T vaccine will be similar to 
that of the other licensed Hib vaccines. TETRAMUNE Trademark 
     On March 30, 1993, the FDA approved a combined diphtheria and tetanus 
toxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Haemophilus b conjugate 
vaccine. TETRAMUNE Trademark, available from Lederle-Praxis Biologicals (Pearl 
River, New York), combines two previously licensed products, DTP (TRIIMMUNOL 
Registered, manufactured by Lederle Laboratories Pearl River, New York) and 
Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine (HibTITER Registered, manufactured by Praxis 
Biologics, Inc. Rochester, New York). 
     This vaccine has been licensed for use in children aged 2 months-5 years 
for protection against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and Hib disease when 
indications for vaccination with DTP vaccine and Haemophilus b conjugate 
vaccine coincide. Based on demonstration of co mparable or higher antibody 
responses to each of the components of the two vaccines, TETRAMUNE Trademark 
is expected to provide protection against Hib, as well as diphtheria, tetanus, 
and pertussis, equivalent to that of already licensed formulations of other 
DTP and Haemophilus b vaccines. 
     The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that 
all infants receive a primary series of one of the licensed Haemophilus b 
conjugate vaccines beginning at 2 months of age and a booster dose at age 12-
15 months (5). The ACIP also recommends that all infants receive a four-dose 
primary series of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine at 2, 
4, 6, and 15-18 months of age, and a booster dose at 4-6 years (6-8). A 
complete statement regarding recommendations for use of ActHIB Trademark and 
TETRAMUNE Trademark is being developed.

            International Workshop Explores Oral Manifestations of
                                 HIV Infection

                             NIDR Research Digest
                             written by Jody Dove
                                  March 1993
                     National Institute of Dental Research

     At the Second International Workshop on the Oral Manifestations of HIV 
Infection, held January 31-February 3 in San Francisco, participants explored 
issues related to the epidemiology, basic molecular virology, mucosal 
immunology, and oral clinical presentations of HIV infection. 
     The workshop was organized by Dr. John Greenspan and Dr. Deborah 
Greenspan of the Department of Stomatology, School of Dentistry, University of 
California, San Francisco.  An international steering committee and scientific 
program committee provided guidance. 
     The conference drew more than 260 scientists from 39 countries, including 
Asia, Africa, Europe, Central America, South America, as well as the United 
States and Canada.  Support tor the workshop was provided by the National 
Institute of Dental Research, the National Cancer Institute, the National 
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the NIH Office of AIDS Research, 
and the Procter and Gamble Company. 
     Among the topics discussed were: the epidemiology of HIV lesions; ethics, 
professional responsibility, and public policy; occupational issues; provision 
of oral care to the HIV-positive population; salivary HIV transmission and 
mucosal immunity; opportunistic infections; pediatric HIV infection; and 
women's issues. 

                                Recommendations

     Recommendations emerged from the workshop to define the association 
between the appearance of oral lesions and rate of progression of HIV, to 
establish a universal terminology for HIV-associated oral lesions, to look for 
more effective treatments for oral manifestations, to expand molecular biology 
studies to understand the relationship between HIV infection and common oral 
lesions, and to study the effects of HIV therapy on oral lesions. 

                                 Epidemiology

     Since the First International Workshop on Oral Manifestations of HIV 
Infection was convened five years ago, the epidemiology of HIV infection has 

HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11

radically changed.  In 1988, HIV infection was detected and reported largely 
in homosexual and bisexual males, intravenous drug users, and hemophiliacs.  
Today, more HIV infection is seen in heterosexual males and females and in 
children and adolescents. 
     While the predominant impact of HIV infection has been felt in Africa, a 
major increase in infection rate is being seen in Southeast Asia as well.  
Five hundred thousand cases have been reported to date in this region and more 
are appearing all the time. 
     Researchers are continuing to document the epidemiology of oral lesions 
such as hairy leukoplakia and candidiasis.  They also are beginning to explore 
the relationships between specific oral lesions and HIV disease progression 
and prognosis. 

                            Social/political Issues

     Discussion on the social and political implications of HIV infection 
focused on changing the public's attitude that AIDS is retribution for 
indiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use.  Speakers also addressed health 
care delivery for HIV-infected patients, and the need to educate the public 
about what AIDS is, and how it is acquired. 

                          Saliva and Salivary Glands

     Conference speakers described transmission issues and the HIV-inhibitory 
activity of saliva, the strength of which varies among the different salivary 
secretions.  Whole saliva has a greater inhibitory effect than submandibular 
secretions, which in turn have a greater inhibitory effect than parotid 
secretions.  Research has shown that at least two mechanisms are responsible 
for salivary inhibitory activity.  They attributed the HIV-inhibitory effect 
of saliva to the 1) aggregation/agglutination of HIV by saliva, which may both 
promote clearance of virus and prevent it reaching a target cell, and 2) 
direct effects on the virus or target cells. 
     Other topics discussed were the manifestation of salivary gland disease 
in HIV-infected persons and current research on oral mucosal immunity. 

                               Pediatric Issues

     Pediatric AIDS recently has emerged as an area of intense interest.  With 
early and accurate diagnosis and proper treatment, the life expectancy of HIV-
infected children has tripled.  The prevention of transmission of HIV from 
mother to child may be possible in many cases, particularly if the mother's 
sero-status is known prior to giving birth. 

                    Periodontal and Gingival Tissue Disease

Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993

     Oral health researchers continue to explore periodontal diseases and 
gingivitis found in individuals with HIV infection.  Recommendations made at 
the workshop include the standardization of terminology, refinement of 
diagnostic markers, standardization of study design, and proper consideration 
of confounding variables resulting from periodontal therapy. 

                       Occupational and Treatment Issues

     Occupational issues surrounding the treatment of HIV-infected individuals 
and treatment rendered by HIV-infected health care professionals still command 
considerable attention.  Factors under consideration include the cost/benefit 
of HIV testing, patient-to-health care provider transmission of HIV infection 
and the reverse, and the use of mainstream versus dedicated facilities for the 
treatment of HIV-infected patients. 
     Conference participants anticipate that a third International Workshop on 
the Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection will be held in five years or less.  
Proceedings from the second workshop will be published by the Quintessence 
Company in late 1993.

              FDA Approves Depo Provera, injectable contraceptive
                      P92-31 Food and Drug Administration
              FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Susan Cruzan - (301) 443-3285


The Food and Drug Administration today announced the approval of Depo Provera, 
an injectable contraceptive drug. 

The drug, which contains a synthetic hormone similar to the natural hormone 
progesterone, protects women from pregnancy for three months per injection. 
The hormone is injected into the muscle of the arm or buttock where it is 
released into the bloodstream to prevent pregnancy. It is more than 99 percent 
effective.

""This drug presents another long-term, effective option for women to prevent 
pregnancy,"" said FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler, M.D. ""As an injectable, 
given once every three months, Depo Provera eliminates problems related to 
missing a daily dose.""

Depo Provera is available in 150 mg. single dose vials from doctors and 
clinics and must be given on a regular basis to maintain contraceptive 
protection. If a patient decides to become pregnant, she discontinues the 
injections.

As with any such products, FDA advises patients to discuss the benefits and 
risks of Depo Provera with their doctor or other health care professional 
before making a decision to use it.

Depo Provera's effectiveness as a contraceptive was established in extensive 
studies by the manufacturer, the World Health Organization and health agencies 
in other countries. U.S. clinical trials, begun in 1963, also found Depo 
Provera effective as an injectable contraceptive.

The most common side effects are menstrual irregularities and weight gain. In 
addition, some patients may experience headache, nervousness, abdominal pain, 
dizziness, weakness or fatigue. The drug should not be used in women who have 
acute liver disease, unexplained vaginal bleeding, breast cancer or blood 
clots in the legs, lungs or eyes.

The labeling advises doctors to rule out pregnancy before prescribing the 
drug, due to concerns about low birth weight in babies exposed to the drug.

Recent data have also demonstrated that long-term use may contribute to 
osteoporosis. The manufacturer will conduct additional research to study this 
potential effect.

Depo Provera was Developed in the 1960s and has been approved for 
contraception in many other countries. The UpJohn Company of Kalamazoo, Mich., 
which will market the drug under the name, Depo Provera Contraceptive 
Injection, first submitted it for approval in the United States in the 1970s. 
At that time, animal studies raised questions about its potential to cause 
breast cancer. Worldwide studies have since found the overall risk of cancer, 
including breast cancer in humans, to be minimal if any.

       New Rules Speed Approval of Drugs for Life-Threatening Illnesses
                      P92-37 Food and Drug Administration
                        Monica Revelle - (301) 443-4177

The Food and Drug Administration today announced that it will soon publish new 
rules to shed the approval of drugs for patients with serious or life-
threatening illnesses, such as AIDS, cancer and Alzheimer's disease. 

""These final rules will help patients who are suffering the most serious 
illnesses to get access to new drugs months or even years earlier than would 
otherwise be possible,"" said HHS Secretary Louis W. Sullivan, M.D. ""The effort 
to accelerate FDA review for these drugs has been a long-term commitment and 
indeed a hallmark of this administration."" 

These rules establish procedures for the Food and Drug Administration to 
approve a drug based on ""surrogate endpoints"" or markers. They apply when the 
drug provides a meaningful benefit over currently available therapies. Such 
endpoints would include laboratory tests or physical signs that do not in 
themselves constitute a clinical effect but that are judged by qualified 
scientists to be likely to correspond to real benefits to the patient. 

Use of surrogate endpoints for measurement of drug efficacy permits approval 
earlier than if traditional endpoints -- such as relief of disease symptoms or 
prevention of disability and death from the disease -- are used. 

The new rules provide for therapies to be approved as soon as safety and 
effectiveness, based on surrogate endpoints, can be reasonably established. 
The drug's sponsor will be required to agree to continue or conduct 
postmarketing human studies to confirm that the drug's effect on the surrogate 
endpoint is an indicator of its clinical effectiveness. 

One new drug -- zalcitabine (also called ddC) -- was approved June 19, using a 
model of this process, for treating the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, the 
cause of AIDS. 

Accelerated approval can also be used, if necessary, when FDA determines that 
a drug, judged to be effective for the treatment of a disease, can be used 
safely only under a restricted distribution plan. 

""The new rules will help streamline the drug development and review process

               Research Shows Promise for Preventing or Slowing
                       Blindness due to Retinal Disease

                   National Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation

        Neutrophilic Factors Rescue Photoreceptor Cells in Animal Tests

     Baltimore, MD - Researchers at the University of California San Francisco 
and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. [NASDAQ: REGN] have discovered that 
certain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can 
prevent the degeneration of light-sensing cells in the retina of the eye. The 
degeneration of these cells, known as photoreceptors, is a major cause of 
visual impairment 
     This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of 
the National Academy of Science (PNAS), holds promise for people who may lose 
their sight due to progressive retinal degeneration -- currently, no drug 
treatment for retinal degeneration exists. It is estimated that 2.5 million 
Americans have severe vision loss due to age-related macular degeneration and 
100,000 Americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus, a hereditary disease 
that causes blindness. In addition, each year more than 15,000 people undergo 
surgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal traumas. 
     The research was funded in part by the RP (Retinitis Pigmentosa) 
Foundation Fighting Blindness, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and the National Eye 
Institute. It was conducted by Drs. Matthew M. LaVail, Kazuhiko Unoki, Douglas 
Yasurnura, Michael T. Matthes and Roy H. Steinberg at UCSF, arld Dr. C;eorge 
Yancoooulos, Regeneron's Vice President for Discovery. Regeneron holds an 
exclusive license for this research from UCSF.
     In the research described in the PNAS , a light-damage model was used to 
assess the survival-promoting activity of a number of naturally occurring 
substances. Experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week. 
Eyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of their 
photoreceptor cells -- the rods and cones of the retina -- after light 
exposure. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Ciliary Neurotrophic 
Factor (CNTF) were particularly effective in this model without causing 
unwanted side effects; other factors such as Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and 
Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1) were not effective in these experiments. 
     Discussing the research, Dr. Jesse M. Cedarbaum, Regeneron's Director of 
Clinical Research, said, ""BDNF's ability to rescue neurons in the retina that 
have been damaged by light exposure may hold promise for the treatment of age-
related macular degeneration, one of the leading causes of vision impairment, 
and for retinal detachment. Following detachment, permanent vision loss may

result frorn the death of detached retinal cells. It is possible that BDNF 
could play a role in rescuing those cells once the retina has been reattached 
surgically."" 
     ""Retinitis pigmentosa is a slowly progressing disease that causes the 
retina to degenerate over a period of years or even decades. Vision decreases 
to a small tunnel of sight and can result in total blindness. It is our hope 
that research on growth factors will provide a means to slow the progression 
and preserve useful vision throughout life,"" stated Jeanette S. Felix, Ph.D., 
Director of Science for the RP Foundation Fighting Blindness. 
     In addition to the work described , Regeneron is developing BDNF in 
conjunction with Aingen Inc. [NASDAQ:AMGN] as a possible treatment for 
peripheral neuropathies associated with diabetes and cancer chemotherapy, 
motor neuron diseases, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. By 
itself, Regeneron is testing CNTF in patients with arnyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease). 
     Regeneron Pharlnaceuticals, Inc., based in Tarrytown, New York, is a 
leader in the discovery and development of biotechnology-based compounds for 
the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, peripheral neuropathies and nerve 
injuries, which affect more than seven million Americans. Drs. LaVail and 
Steinberg of UCSF are consultants to Regeneron.

                 Affluent Diet Increases Risk Of Heart Disease

     High-fat, high-calorie diets rapidly increase risk factors for coronary 
heart disease in native populations of developing countries that have 
traditionally consumed diets low in fat.  These findings, according to 
investigators at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, have 
serious implications for public health in both industrialized and developing 
countries. 
     ""This study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease and 
have higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels.  It shows also the 
importance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body 
weight, thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developing 
countries and affluent nations as well,"" explains principal investigator Dr. 
William E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid 
metabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University. 
     Over the past 25 years Dr. Connor and his team have characterized the 
food and nutrient intakes of the Tara humara Indians in Mexico, while 
simultaneously documenting various aspects of Tarahumara lipid metabolism.  
These native Mexicans number approximately 50,000 and reside in the Sierra 
Madre Occidental Mountains in the state of Chihuahua.  The Tarahumaras have 
coupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing.  Probably as a result, coronary 
heart disease, which is so prevalent in Western industrialized nations, is 
virtually non existent in their culture.  Loosely translated, the name 
Tarahumara means ""fleet of foot,"" reflecting a tribal passion for betting on 
""kickball"" races, in which participants run distances of 100 miles or more 
while kicking a machete-carved wooden ball.
     The typical Tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans, tortillas, 
and pinole, a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water, 
together with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables.  The Tara humaras 
also eat small amounts of game, fish, and eggs.  Their food contains 
approximately 12 percent of total calories as fat of which the majority (69 
percent) is of vegetable origin.  Dietician Martha McMurry, a coinvestigator 
in the study, describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while 
low in cholesterol and fat.
     The Tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of 121 mg/ dL, 
low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels of 72 mg/dl, and high-density 
lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels of 32 to 42 mg/dl.  All of those values 
are in the good, low-risk range, according to the researchers.  Elevated 
cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart 

HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 20
Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993

disease.  HDL-cholesterol is considered beneficial.  In previous studies the 
Tarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease, although 
able to respond to high-cholesterol diets with elevations in total and LDL-
cholesterol. 
     Clinical Research Center dietitian McMurry and coinvestigator Maria 
Teresa Cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a Jesuit mission school 
building near a community hospital in the small village of Sisoguichi.  Food 
was weighed, cooked, and fed to the study participants under the 
investigators' direct supervision, ensuring that subjects ate only food 
stipulated by the research protocol.  Fasting blood was drawn twice weekly, 
and plasma samples were frozen and shipped to Dr. Connors laboratory for 
cholesterol, triglyceride, and lipoprotein analyses.  Regular measurements 
included participant body weight, height, and triceps skin fold thickness.  
Thirteen Tarahumaras, five women and eight men, including one adolescent, were 
fed their native diet for 1 week, followed by 5 weeks of an ""affluent"" diet. 
     ""In this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was 40 
percent of total calories.  This is the prototype of the holiday diet that 
many Americans consume a diet high in fat, sugar, and cholesterol, low in 
fiber,"" elaborates Dr. Conners. Such dietary characteristics are reflected in 
the cholesterol-saturation index, or CSI, recently devised research dietitian 
Sonja Conner working with Dr. Connor.  ""The CSI is a single number that 
incorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat in 
the diet.  CSI indicates the diet's potential to elevate the cholesterol 
level, particularly the LDL,"" Dr. Connor explains.  The Tarahumaran diet 
averages a very low CSI of 20; Dr. Connor's ""affluent"" diet used in the study 
ranks a CSI of 149. 
     The experimental design of this study reflects the importance of 
establishing baseline plasma lipid levels, typical of the native diet, before 
exposing subjects to the experimental diet.  The standard curve relating 
dietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off, or 
plateau, for consumption of large amounts of fat.  Changes in dietary fat 
and/or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels.  ""You 
must have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to put 
into the experimental diet.  The Framingham study, for example, did not 
discriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease 
because the diet was already high in fat.  All subjects were already eating on 
a plateau,"" Dr. Connor says. 
     After 5 weeks of consuming the ""affluent"" diet, the subjects' mean plasma 
cholesterol levels had in creased by 31 percent, primarily in the LDL 
fraction, which rose 39 percent.  HDL-cholesterol increased by 31 per cent, 
and LDL to HDL ratios changed therefore very little.  Plasma triglyceride 
levels increased by 18 percent, and subjects averaged an 8-pound gain in 
weight.  According to Dr. Connor, lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon, 
yielding nearly the same results after 7 days of affluent diet as after 35 
days. 

HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 21
Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993

     The increase in HDL carries broad dietary implications for industrialized 
nations.  ""We think HDL-cholesterol increased because we increased the amount 
of dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous Tarahumara metabolic 
study.  In that study we saw no change in HDL levels after raising the dietary 
cholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption.  
In the present study we increased fat intake to 40 percent of the total 
calories.  We reached the conclusion in the Tarahumara study that HDL reflects 
the amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary 
cholesterol.  HDL must increase to help metabolize the fat, and it increased 
quite a bit in this study,"" Dr. Connor explains.
     Low HDL in the Tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of 
coronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of 
fat or cholesterol.  HDL remains an important predictor to Americans because 
of their usual high fat intake. 
     Dr. Connor recommends a diet for Americans that contains less than 20 
percent of total calories as fat, less than 100 mg of cholesterol, and a CSI 
around 20, varying in accordance with caloric needs.  Such a diet is low in 
meat and dairy fat, high in fiber.  Dr. Connor also comments on recent 
suggestions that Americans adopt a ""Mediterranean-style"" diet.  ""The original 
Mediterranean diet, in its pristine state, consisted of a very low intake of 
fat and very few animal and dairy products.  We are already eating a lot of 
meat and dairy products.  Simply to continue that pattern while switching to 
olive oil is not going to help the situation."" 
     The World Health Organization (WHO) is focusing much attention on the 
emergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies 
undergoing technological development.  Dr. Connor says that coronary heart 
disease starts with a given society's elite, who typically eat a different 
diet than the average citizen.  ""If the pattern of afluence increases, the 
entire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease, 
which places a termendous health care burden on a society.  WHO would like the 
developing countries to prevent coronary heart disease, so they can 
concentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public 
health measures to improve general well-being, rather than paying for 
unnecessary, expensive medical technology,"" Dr. Connors says.
     ""The overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move 
their plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a high-risk range within a 
very short time by an affluent, excessive diet.  The present rate of coronary 
heart disease in the United States is 30 percent less than it was 20 years 
ago, so a lot has been accomplished.  We are changing rapidly,"" he concludes.

I don't have any evidence against water from Lourdes curing MS --
I'm sure there is anecdotal evidence that it does.  Do you really think
that in the absence of a double-blind study I should be indifferent
to the hypothesis that water from Lourdes cures MS?

For what it's worth, I know of only one double blind study of Nystatin
for ""candida hypersensitivity syndrome.""  It was published in the 
New England Journal (I think 1990) and showed no benefit on systemic
symptoms (though I think it reduced vaginal yeast infections, not
surprisingly).  As I recall, the yeast crowd had some major objections
to the study, though I don't remember what they were.

Hi,

Thought I'd add something to the conversation. 

My girlfriend used to work in a lab studying different natural carcinogens.
She mentioned once about the cancerous effect of barbecued food.
Basically, she said that if you eat barbecued foods with strawberries
(a natural carcinogen) the slight carcinogenic properties of both
cancel out each other.

Summary: Two important clarifications to previous post of mine ...


This is to followup my previous reply on this topic, which it has been
pointed out to me might have been dangerously misleading in two spots.

1.  I stated that psychotherapy (meaning talking therapy and so on) was used 
    to treat Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, which though sometimes true is 
    misleading.  It is not often found effective, particularly by itself.
    Primary treatment today usually consists at least in part of drug
    therapy.  The most current theories of this condition attribute 
    it to more to biological causes than psychological, in places where this
    distinction becomes important.

2.  I mentioned that the DSM-IIIR mentions 'impulses' as a possible 
	diagnostic marker.  However, this might look like something
	people associate with psychotic conditions, uncontrollable or
	unpredictable behaviors, which is NOT the case with OCD.  
	One of the diagnostic criteria of OCD is that the individual
	can and does suppress some of their 'impulses,' although they
	are an unending source of anxiety.  
	The obsessive thoughts and ritualistic actions usually associated with 
	OCD are most frequently very mundane and predictable, closer to
	a superstitious nature than a dangerous nature for the most part.

	Some references (one non-technical and several technical)
	that someone was kind enough to supply for me
	but was unable to post themself :

Perhaps I should quit eating mushrooms, soya beans, and brie cheese
which all have MSG in them.  It occurs naturally.

I'm not going to quit eating something that I like just because
it *might* cause me trouble later or causes problems in *some*
people.  I would much rather avoid stress by not worrying over
what goes in my mouth and not spending every day reading conflicting
reports of what is good/bad for you.

I may eat some things in quantities that may not be good for me.
Fine.  I've made my decision and I don't think it's appropriate
for anyone to try to 'convert' me.  ""It's for your own good"" are
the most obnoxious and harmful words, IMO, in the English (or
any other) language.

it is, so what?  Give people all the information but don't ram

Any rocky mountain spotted fever experts out there ?

The doctor thinks a friend might have this.
The question is, doesn't the tick have to bite you ?

You frequently find a tick crawling on you after a walk
in the woods around here, but you tend to notice it before
it bites you; pulling one out of your skin is something
you're not likely to forget.

Can you get the fever without it biting you ?  Do they
sometimes bite you and then let go so you don't realize
you were bitten ?  I know they will let go once they've had
their fill, but you certainly would notice this (arggh).

So how do you get the fever if you never pulled a tick
off yourself (as opposed to finding one merely crawling
on you) ?

I don't know the first thing about yeast infections but I am a scientist.
No scientist would take your statement --- ""no convincing empirical evidence
to support the existence of systemic yeast syndrome"" --- to tell you
anything except an absence of data on the question.  Noring has pointed out
the catch-22 that if the ""crazy"" theory were true, you probably couldn't
find any direct evidence of it --- that you couldn't observe those yeastie
beasties with present methods even if they were there.  Noring and the
fellow from Oklahoma (sorry, forgot your name) have also suggested one set
of anecdotal evidence in favor based on their personal experiences ---
namely, that when people with certain conditions are given anti-fungals,
many of them appear to get better.  

So, if you have any evidence *against* the hypothesis --- for example,
controlled double-blind studies showing that the anti-fungals don't do any
better than sugar water --- then let's hear it.  If you don't, then what we
have is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side, and abject
disbelief on the other.  In which case, please, there is no point in yelling
back and forth at each other any longer since neither side has any
convincing evidence either positive or negative.  

And I understand that your abject disbelief is based on the existence of
people who may get famous or make money applying the diagnosis to everything
in sight, making wild claims with no evidence, and always refusing to do
controlled studies.  But that has absolutely no bearing on the apparently
sincere experiences of the people on the net observing anti-fungals working
on themselves and other people in certain specific cases.  There are also
quacks who sell oral superoxide dismutase, in spite of the fact that it's
completely broken down in the guts, but this doesn't change the genuine
scientific knowledge about the role of superoxide dismutase in fighting
oxidative damage.  Same thing.  Just cause there are candida quacks, that
doesn't establish evidence against the candida hypothesis.  If there's some
other reason (besides the quacks), if only anecdotal, to think it could be
true, then that is what has to be considered, that is what the net people
have been talking about.

But again, there is no point in arguing about it.  There is anecdotal
evidence, and there is no convincing evidence, and there are also some
candida quacks out there, I hope everyone can agree on all of that.  Thus,
it appears to me the main question now is whether the proponents can
marshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and documented enough
manner to make a good case for carrying out a good controlled double-blind
study of antifungals (or else, forget convincing anybody else to carry out
the test, just carry it out themselves!) --- and also, whether they can
adequately define the patient population or symptoms on which such a study
should be carried out to provide a fair test of the hypothesis.

I read a great book about eye dominance several years ago. So there is one
book out there..at least one :).

There were several types of eye dominance. Where a person looks in their
memory usually indicates a type of eye dominanc Another type is related to
coordination activities like hitting a ball. Another for reading. 

I didn't read one that discussed prescription strength. Although people
with bad vision, near or far sighted would tend to depend on the stronger
eye.

Yogurt contains Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. bulgaricus.  L. 
acidophilus is the major bacteria in the vaginal tract and is primarily 
responsible for keeping the vaginal tract acidic and yeast free.  Most of 
the commercial yogurt sold in the U.S. has a very low L. acidophilus and L. 
bulgaricus count.  Neither of these bacteria are obligate anaerobes with are 
much more important in dealing with the diarrhea problem.  Gordon R. has told 
me through e-mail that he gives his patients L. acidophilus and several 
different obligate anaerobes(which set-up shop in the colon) but he hasn't 
told me which ones yet.  The Lactobacillus genera are mostly facultative 
anaerobes and will set-up shop where they have access to oxygen if given a 
chance(mouth, anus, sinus cavity and vagina).  Having these good bacteria 
around will greatly decrease the chance of candida blooms in the anal 
region or the vagina.  I have not proposed a systemic action for candida 
blooms.  I know that others swear that all kinds of symptoms arise from 
the evil yeast blooms in the body.  I'm not ready to buy that yet.  I do 
believe that complications at specific sites(vagina, anal and maybe lower 
colon, sinus and mouth) can result from antibiotic use which removes the 
competing bacteria from these sites and thus lets candida grow unchecked.
Restoring the right bacterial balance is the best way(in my opinion) to get 
rid of the problem.  Anti-fungals, a low carbohydrate diet and vitamin A 
supplementation may all help to minimize the local irritation until the 
good bacteria can take over control of the food supply again and lower the 
pH to basically starve the candida out.

You need to use your shoulder muscles to push the mower. If you haven't been

Apart from the fact that you get G in the pull-out, not the dive, that
figure is about right for sustained G, no protection.
The duration of G, it's rate of onset, body position and support aids are
all critical parts of the equation. I remember one note about instrumented
gridiron players recording peaks about 200G. Stapp, the aviation doctor,
either by accident or design, took a short-period 80G in a rocket-sled
decelleration, eye-balls-out against a standard (1950's) harness. It had
to be short, calculate the stopping time, even from 500 - 600mph at that
G. A bang-seat can get up to about 60 G, and you'd better be sitting
straight. Find the book by Martin-Bakers human guinea pig to hear how bad
it can get if the rate of onset is too high. A reclining position and a
good G-suit can keep a pilot functioning at around 12G.

A flotation tank should be a good bet, since you can treat the body as a
fluid, and high-pressure situations are not new. Anyone have any figures?

Much of Cook's later exploration was privately funded, by Joseph Banks
among others (eg in Resolution & the earlier Endeavour).  Colnett's voyage
to the Galapagos was substantially privately funded by the owners of
British whaling vessels.  Chancellor and Willoughby were privately funded
by London merchant companies in their voyages to Muscovy.  The list is
almost endless.  Those doing the funding were about eighty percent
motivated by potential profit, ten percent by potential glory and ten
percent by the desire to advance the sum of human knowledge.

This was on ""That's Incredible"" several years ago.  The volume of liquid
the rat had to breath was considerably smaller than what a human would have
to breath, so maybe it is possible for a rat but not a human.

It may be a NEW Physics problem (i.e. a problem involving new
physics).  However, the data is not good enough to rule out the >100
models which use old physics.  New physics is a big step, and is only
tolerated when there is no alternative.  For example , the Dark Matter
Problem (there's more to the universe than meets the eye) is a question
of comparable mystery to GRBs, but we have much better data regarding
it.  Theoreticians postulate new particles all the time to explain it,
but no one will actually believe that these particles are real until an
experimentalist (or several) detects them in the lab.

Well pat for once I agree with you and I like your first idea that you had.
IT probably is the gamma ray signature of the warp transitions of interstellar
spacecraft! :)

Well it makes as much sense as some things. I was at the first Gamma Ray
Burst conference here at UAH and had great fun watching the discomfiture
of many of the Gamma Ray scientists. Much scruitiny was given to the
data reductions. I remember one person in particular who passionately declared
that the data was completely wrong as there were no explanation for the
phenomena of the smooth sky distribution. (heck it even shoots down the
warp transition theory :(. The next conference is soon and I will endeavour
to keep in touch with this fun subject.

I'm not sure if this is a big issue, but it seems to me like it
might be -- up till now, all >1g forces applied to the mirror and
its mounting (and nearly all =1g forces) have been applied along the
telescope's optical axis, and against the mirror's base.  Reentry
would apply forces along roughly the same axis, but tending to pull
the mirror away from the mount, and the landing would apply on-edge
forces to both the mirror and mount.  It could be that one or both
of these would not survive.

Yes, weightlessness does feel like falling.  It may feel strange at first,
but the body does adjust.  The feeling is not too different from that
of sky diving.

It is the body's reaction to a strange environment.  It appears to be induced
partly to physical discomfort and part to mental distress.  Some people are 
more prone to it than others, like some people are more prone to get sick 
on a roller coaster ride than others.  The mental part is usually induced by 
a lack of clear indication of which way is up or down, ie: the Shuttle is 
normally oriented with its cargo bay pointed towards Earth, so the Earth 
(or ground) is ""above"" the head of the astronauts.  About 50% of the astronauts 
experience some form of motion sickness, and NASA has done numerous tests in 
space to try to see how to keep the number of occurances down.

I don't have any plausible models for GRBs at any distances ;-)

   Recent observations have just about ruled out the merging neutron star
   hypothesis, which had a lot of problems, anyhow.  We have to look for
   implausible models and what is fundamentally allowed independent of
   models.

Hmm, the ""superbowl"" burst has been claimed in press releases
to cast doubt on the merging NS hypothesis, from what I've read
(and I haven't seen the papers, only the press) I'd say it is
consistent with some of the merging NS models

   A paper on the possibility of GRB's in the Oort cloud just came
   through the astrophysics abstract service.  To get a copy of this

   Here is the abstract of that paper.

 ...
      indicator to these events all possible sources which are
      isotropically distributed should remain under consideration. This is
      why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list,
      although there is no known mechanism for generating \GRBs
      from cometary nuclei. Unlikely as it may seem, the possibility that \GRBs
      originate in the solar cometary cloud
      cannot be excluded until it is disproved.

This does not propose a _mechanism_ for GRBs in the Oort (and, no,
anti-matter annihilation does not fit the spectra at least as far
as I understand annihilation spectra...). Big difference.
That's ignoring the question of how you fit a distribution
to the Oort distribution when the Oort distribution is not well
known - in particular comet aphelia (which are not well known)
are not a good measure of the Oort cloud distribution...

would agree the sky is beautiful, but not that it is public or private property.

I personally prefer natural skies, far from city lights and sans aircraft.

HST is about 25,500 lbs (11,600 kg).  That doesn't include the cradle that
would have been in the cargo bay when it was deployed.  Spacelab-J on STS-47
was 21,861 lbs (according to the press-kit). 

As someone else pointed out if they had been unable to deploy it for some
reason that would have had to land with it still in the cargo bay and this
was a planned for contingency.  This is not a problem for the shuttle,
though it would eliminate KSC as a landing site, they still have to go to
Edwards when landing with something like Spacelab in the cargo bay.

                           April 23 - 29, 1993

SPACECRAFT

1.  On April 22 and 23, delta Differenced One-way Range (DOR) passes were
performed over DSS-14/63 (Goldstone/Madrid 70 meter antennas) and DSS-14/43
(Goldstone/Canberra 70 meter antennas), respectively.  Initial results 
indicate the delta DOR pass on April 22 was unsuccessful due to ground
station hardware problems but the one on April 23 was successfully performed.

2.  On April 23, a cruise science Memory Readout (MRO) was performed for the
Magnetometer (MAG) instrument.  Analysis indicates the data was received
properly.

3.  On April 23, the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via the
spacecraft stored sequence.  These relays were commanded closed by the CDS
(Command Data Subsystem) prior to launch and were again commanded closed to
preclude the possibility at Jupiter of the PPS relays/wiring being a
source of internal electrostatic charge (IESD).

4.  On April 26, cruise science Memory Readouts (MRO) were performed for the
Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer
(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received
properly.

5.  During the period from April 26 to April 27, a navigation cycle was
performed.  This navigation cycle provided near-continuous acquisition of
two-way doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of the
spacecraft over DSS-63, DSS-14, and DSS-43.

6.  On April 26, real-time commands were sent to test slew the Radio Relay
Antenna (RRA) in preparation for the mini-sequence slew test on April 28.
The RRA was slewed from approximately 3.5 degrees from stow to approximately
20.3 degrees.  Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about 18
degrees which was well within the predicted range.  The RRA was commanded back
to approximately 15.2 degrees from stow.  Preliminary analysis indicated the
antenna reached about 15.8 degrees also well within the predicted range.  The
RRA motor temperature was at 1 degree C at the start of the activity and had
increased to 1.6 degrees C at its completion.

     After verifying proper RRA slewing, the RRA slew test mini-sequence was
uplinked to the spacecraft for execution on April 28.  Upon successful uplink,
a Delayed Action Command (DAC) was sent which will reposition the stator on
May 4 to its initial pre-test position.  Also, a DAC was sent to turn the
Two-Way Noncoherent (TWNC) on April 28 prior to the start of the RRA slew test
mini-sequence.

7.  On April 27, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to
264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.

8.  On April 28, the RRA slew test executed nominally.  The spacecraft under
stored sequence control performed six RRA slews starting at about 16 degrees
from stow and going to 53 degrees, back to 25 degrees, then to 51 degrees,
back to 22 degrees, then to 48 degrees and then back to 21 degrees.  All of
the slews were well within the predicted range.  The RRA motor temperature was
at 2.3 degrees C at the start of the activity and had increased to 4.4
degrees C at its completion.  After completion of the RRA slews, real-time
commands were sent to reconfigure back to the pre-test configuration.

9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant change
(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads 17 DN
(3.9 volts).  The DC measurement reads 134 DN (15.7 volts).  These
measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special
anomaly team.

10. The Spacecraft status as of April 29, 1993, is as follows:

       a)  System Power Margin -  75 watts
       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin
       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner
       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 23 degrees
           off-sun (lagging) and 4 degrees off-earth (leading)
       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1
       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within
           acceptable range
       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range
       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,
           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS
       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within

GDS (Ground Data Systems):

1.  The first Galileo-GDS test of the MGDS V18.0 Command System (CMD) took
place April 27, 1993 with DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna).  The test went
well and demonstrated that the new command system interfaced with the new DSN
(Deep Space Network) Group 5 Command Processor Assembly (CPA).  The test was
successful and the next test for V18.0 CMD is scheduled for May 1, 1993 with
DSS-15 (Goldstone 34 meter antenna).

2.  The April System Engineers Monthly Report(SEMR)/Ground System Development
Office (GSDO) MMR was conducted Thursday, April 29.   A review of current
Project and Institutional (DSN and MOSO) system status was conducted.  On-going
cruise development plus the GSDO Phase 1 and 2 delivery schedules, past months
accomplishments  and potential problem areas were discussed.  No significant
schedule changes or significant problems were reported.


TRAJECTORY

     As of noon Thursday, April 29, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory
status was as follows:

	Distance from Earth         187,745,300 km (1.26 AU)
	Distance from Sun           296,335,800 km (1.98 AU)
	Heliocentric Speed          89,100 km per hour
	Distance from Jupiter       522,015,800 km
	Round Trip Light Time       20 minutes, 58 seconds

SPECIAL TOPIC

1.  As of April 29, 1993, a total of 70259 real-time commands have been
transmitted to Galileo since Launch.  Of these, 65150  were initiated in the
sequence design process and 5109 initiated in the real-time command process.
In the past week, 74 real time commands were transmitted: 73 were initiated
in the sequence design process and one initiated in the real time command
process.  Major command activities included commands to perform the initial
RRA slew test, uplink the RRA slew test mini-sequence, DACs to reposition the
stator and turn the TWNC on, reset the command loss timer, and execute the
RRA slew test.

Are you talking about a single BATSE component, or
the whole thing?

You *could* propose a BATSE probe; launch two or three with ion
drive on various planetary trajectories... your resolution increaces
the more they're spaced apart. You could probably cheaply eject them
from the solar system with enough flybys and patience.

Things would start out slow, then slowly get better and better
resolution...

Regarding the feasability of retrieving the HST for repair and
relaunching it:

(Caution: speculation mode engaged)
There is another consideration that hasn't been mentioned yet.
I expect that retrieving HST would involve 'damaging' it considerably in
order to return it to its cradle in the cargo bay.  Most of the deployed
items (antennas and, especially, the solar arays) probably are not
retractable into their fully stowed position, even by hand.  They would
have to be removed by the astronauts.  (The only advantage that this
might yield is that we could put new panels on that don't 'ring' due
to thermal cycle stresses...)

I also expect that, as has been discussed, the landing loads on the
HST optics structure is a big issue (but that the reentry loads are
much less so.)  Can the moveable optical components even be re-caged
(I assume that they were caged for launch)?

Why is the general public going to be interested in the technical details
of long term space habitation?  I like the idea of the study, but it should
be released to other scientists and engineers who will be able to use it.
If you want a general public document, you'll need a more general publication.

As one working on Controlled Ecological Life Support Systems, engineering
the microworld isn't the problem.  The problem is understanding the basic
chemical, biological and medical factors to be able to engineer them
efficiently.  For example, the only way we know how to produce food is from
plants and animals.  Food synthesis is not very far advanced.  So we have
to orbit a farm.  Well that's obviously not very efficient, so we use 
technology to reduce the mass and grow plants hydroponically instead of 
using dirt.  This is where the engineering comes in.  But new technologies
bring new basic questions that we don't have the answers to.  Like, in 
dirt we can grow tomatoes and lettuce right beside each other, but in 
hydroponics it turns out that you can't do that.  The lettuce growth is 
stunted when it's grown in the same hydroponic solution as tomatoes.  So 
now you have to consider what other plants are going to have similar
interactions.  This means some basic applied scientific research.  And that's
what needs to be done with all technologies that have been developed so far.
We also need to find out how they interact together.  That's where we are now.

>So, I would like to see posts of opinions regarding the most objective
>methods to analyze the accepted scientific literature for technologies
>which can be applied to long-duration spaceflight. 

First you need to do the literature search.  There is a lot of information
out there.  Maybe we should just pick a specific area of long term habitation.
This could be useful, especially if we make it available on the net.  Then
we can look at methods of analyzing the technologies.

Unless there is an unbelievable outpouring of interest on this on the net,
I think we should develop a detailed data base of the literature search 
first.  Then if we accomplish that we can go on to real analysis.  The data
base itself could be useful for future engineers.

That's my response Ken, what do you think?

No, the thing is designed to be retrievable, in a pinch.  Indeed, this
dictated a rather odd design for the solar arrays, since they had to be
retractable as well as extendable, and may thus have indirectly contributed
to the array-flapping problems.

The retrieval problems are exactly as stated:  it would be costly, would
involve extensive downtime (and the worry of someone finding a reason not
to re-launch it), and would unnecessarily expose the telescope to a lot
of mechanical stresses and possibilities for contamination.

Originator: news@nimaster

I feel compelled to complain: the statement that recent observations
rule out merging neutron stars as sources of gamma-ray bursts is
utterly false, even though it is popular enough to make it to
BATSE press releases.
The idea behind the statement is as follows: 
     ""if you smack two neutron
      stars together, or have a neutron star be gobbled up by a black hole,
      a lot of energy is released, enough for a gamma-ray burst at a
      cosmological distance. But, so the reasoning continues, this energy 
      is released below a lot of matter, so the radiation becomes
      thermalized and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum.
      The observed spectra are strongly non-thermal, so this model must
      be wrong.""
As so often, the fault lies with the imagination of the person who
was trying to prove the model wrong rather than with the model. It
may be that the initial energy release is not seen as a gamma-ray
burst, but the 'fireball' of energy and matter that is created
may spew out a relativistic flow. When this slams into the surrounding 
medium, a strong flux of non-thermal gamma rays results, which may
carry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy. All
this is not my idea: it is in a series of papers by Martin Rees,
Peter Meszaros (sorry for the missing accents:-) and co-workers.
It is certainly not a complete model, but it may well be the best one
around (summing over all proposed distance scales). An alternative
proposal for what creates the initial fireball, by the way, is the 
so-called 'failed supernovae' scenario by Stan Woosley, in which
a very massive star at the end of its life collapses to a black
hole. If the stellar core was rotating, part of the infalling matter
will be temporarily halted because it is supported by centrifugal
force, and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto the
black hole. This beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis,
which again constitutes relativistic flow. The rate of such
events may be much higher than that of neutron star mergers,
but the flux may be more strongly beamed, so that the net rate
of bursts observed on Earth stays the same between the two
scenarios, but the energy released per event can be a lot less
in the failed supernova scenario.

On another note: I do believe that the distance scale must 
ultimately be resolved via some classical astronomical method
such as finding counterparts to the bursts at other wavelengths,
or finding a definitive signature of some known class of
objects in the distribution of positions and fluxes. Theorists
have historically not been too successfull in finding the
distance of any object by proving that there is only one
possible way in which the object can work, and therefore
it *must* be so-and-so.

I think to some extent this is a case of stooping to their level.  You assume
that the general public ""can't handle the truth"" and then, based on this 
assumption, go for the fluff arguments.  Then someone, who can understand a
good argument, comes along and asks ""why don't you just develop the spinoffs?""
or ""why can't we just get our spinoffs from some other program, like the
military?""  There are some good arguments for space development without relying
on its side effects.  I'm not ignoring the value of spinoffs.  I simply think
that the general public deserves more credit than you give them.

>BTW: don't forget Velcro...

And if you're going to use spinoffs you better make darn sure you are right.
Teflon has been around since before NASA.  As I understand it, Velcro was 
conceptualized by a french doctor who went walking in the woods and took the
trouble to wonder how burrs stick to your clothes.  Certainly velcro was 
available on hiking equipment by the early to mid sixties.  I would need to 
see some good evidence before I believe that either of these would not be here
today without NASA.

Is there a plan to put a satellite around each planet in the solar system to
keep watch? I help it better to ask questions before I spout an opinion.

How about a mission (unmanned) to Pluto to stay in orbit and record things
around and near and on Pluto.. I know it is a strange idea, but why not??
It could do some scanning of not only Pluto, but also of the solar system,
objects near and aaroundpluto, as well as SETI and looking at the galaxy

        I had to turn to one of my problem sets that I did in class for this
little problem.  I don't have a calculator, but I DO have the problem set that
we did not too long ago, so I'll use that, and hope it's what you wanted.  
This is a highly simplified problem, with a very simple burst.  Bursts are
usually more complex than this example I will use here.
        Our burst has a peak flux of 5.43E-6 ergs cm^-2 sec^-1 and a duration
of 8.95 seconds.  During the frst second of the burst, and the last 4 seconds,
its flux is half of the peak flux.  It's flux is the peak flux the rest of the
time.  Assume that the background flux is 10E-7 erg cm^-2 sec^-1.
        Then we had to find the integrated luminosity of the burst, for several

energetic for close by.  for the coronal model, we found around 10^43 erg/sec.

moderately energetic, I'd say.  Any suggestions about what could put out that

People who criticize ""big Government"" and its projects rarely seem to
have a consistent view of the role of Government in science and
technology.  Basically, the U.S. Government has gotten into the role of
supporting research which private industry finds too expensive or too
long-term.  

(Historically, this role for the U.S. Gov't was forced upon it because
of socialism in other countries.  In order for U.S.  industries to
compete with government-subsidized foreign competitors, the U.S. Gov't
has taken on the role of subisizing big-ticket or long-lead R&D.)

As a Republican, I abhor the necessity for our Government to involve
itself in technology this way.  I believe that market forces should
drive technology, and the world would be a better place for it.  But
the whole world would have to implement this concept simultaneously, or
some countries would have subsidized R&D, while others would not.  So
the U.S. must subsidize because everybody else does.  (This sounds a
lot like the farm subsidies arguments behind our GATT negotiations,
doesn't it?)

But this role of Government subsidies is antithetical to
cost-effectiveness.  The general idea is to spend money on new
technology, and thereby maintain and promote our technological culture,
despite the forces in the business world (like the dreaded quarterly
earnings report) which erode the ability of U.S. industry to invest in
new technology.  And since our goal is to spend money, it makes little
sense to try to save money.

Of course, we could always spend our money more wisely, but EVERYBODY
disagrees about that the wisdom should be.  

It's interesting to note that some of our best tools for cost control
available in industry today were derived from Government projects.
GANTT charts, CP/M, and most of the modern scheduling software comes
from DoD projects and their contractors.  The construction industry
has taken these tools to the core of their businesses; every large
construction project now uses these tools.

RIght now the HST sevicing mission is listed as 11 days.  before
it was listed as 9 days.  they just kicked up the number of spacewalks
to 5,  after simulations indicated  that it was not do-able in 4.  

After all the space walking,  they are going to  re-boost the HST's
orbit.  I think right now  it's sitting  at 180 miles up,
they would like  220.  I don't know the exact orbit numbers.
I know when HST was first flown, it was placed in the Highest
possible Shuttle orbit. 

Now the shuttle can cary a thing called the EDO pallet, or extended
duration orbiter pallet.  It's mostly  LOX/LH for the fuel cells
and RCS gear,  plus more O2  and canisters for the life support
re-breathers.  maybe more nitrogen too.

THe limit on space-walking is a function of suit supplies (MASS)
and Orbiter Duration.   

In order to perform the re-boost of the HST, the OMS engines
will be fired for a long period.  Now the shuttle is a heavy
thing.  THe HST isn't light either.  THe amount of OMS fuel
needed to fly both up is substantial.   a small booster
carried up and used to boost HST on it's own will weigh significantly
less then the OMS fuel required to Boost  both HST and SHUttle,
for a given orbital change.  

From what i understand,  the mass margins on the HST missions are
tight enough they can't even carry extra Suits or MMU's.

Now if they used a small tug,  I would bet,  just a wild guess,
that the savings on amss margin  would allow carrying the
EDO pallet,  extra suits,  more consumables,  parts for the
flaky FGS sensor,  parts for the balky solar  electronics,

and still enough for a double magnum of champagne.

or the HST could even get placed into  some sort of medium orbit.
The reason they want a high orbit, is less antenna pointing,
and longer drag life.

If you're doing large-scale satellite servicing, being able to do it in
a pressurized hangar makes considerable sense.  The question is whether
anyone is going to be doing large-scale satellite servicing in the near

You'd almost certainly use air.  Given that you have to pressurize with
*something*, safety considerations strongly suggest making it breathable
(even if the servicing crew is using oxygen masks for normal breathing,
to avoid needing a ventilation system, it's nice if the hangar atmosphere
is breathable in a pinch -- it makes mask functioning much less critical).

I haven't seen any specifics on the HST repair mission, but I can't see why
the mass margins are tight.  What are they carrying up?  Replacement components
(WFPC II, COSTAR, gyros, solar panels, and probably a few others), all sorts of
tools, EVA equipment, and as much OMS fuel and consumables as they can.  This
should be lighter than the original HST deployment mission, which achieved the
highest altitude for a shuttle mission to date.  And HST is now in a lower 
orbit.  

Seems like the limiting factors would be crew fatigue and mission complexity.

We are interested in constructing a reentry vehicle to be deployed from a
tether attached to an orbiting platform.  This will be a follow on to our
succesful deployment of a 20 kilometer tether on the March 29 flight of
SEDS (Small Expendable Deployment System), which released an instrumented
payload that reentered the earth's atmosphere and burned up over the west
coast of Mexico.  This time we want to make a payload that can be recovered.
We want to build it from ""off the shelf"" technology so as to do this as
quickly and inexpensively as possible.  We want to be able to track the
payload after it has deployed its parachute.  An idea we have is to put the
same kind of radio beacon on it that is used with SARSATs (Search and Rescue
Satellites).  It would turn on with the opening of the parachute and aid in
tracking.  These beacons are known in the marine industry as EPIRBs
(Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon).  They are rugged (they have to
be to survive a ship wreck!) and cheap.  We have several questions:

1.  What is the world authority regulating the use of SARSAT beacons.  Are
there multiple authorites, i.e. military and civilian?

2.  What are the regulations regarding the use of SARSAT signals.  Can they
be used for one of a kind situations with a long lead time of warning the
relevant authorities, or are they strictly reserved for life threatening
emergencies?

3.  What is the coverage of SARSATS?  Are they in LEO with only intermittant
coverage of a fixed position on the earth, or are they in geosynchronous
orbit?

4.  Is there an industry organization governing the use and manufacture of
these transponders?

   Boeing has been looking at several TSTO vehicles and has carried
out extensive conceptual studies of advanced launch systems for some
time.  A good reference on this might be: ""Comparison of Propulsion
Options for Advanced Earth-To-Orbit (ETO) Applications (IAF-92-
0639)."" by V.A. Weldon and L.E. Fink from Boeing.   The paper
describes a propane-fueled TSTO launch system claimed to achieve
aircraft-like operational efficiencies without the problems
associated with liquid hydrogen fuel.  Basically, it's a high-speed
airplane launching a Hermes-type spaceplane
   The design (the concept is also called ""Beta"") as laid out in the
paper can launch at least 10,000 pounds into polar orbit, or 20,000
pounds to space station orbit including a crew of eight persons and
life support.  System design reliability is .9995.
   Beta is a 360-foot-long first stage powered by two large ramjets
and 12 high- speed civil transport (HSCT) turbofans.  A 108-foot-
long reusable orbiter is trapeze-mounted in the belly of the first-
stage aircraft, which also could accommodate a longer and heavy
payload on an expendable second stage.
   To launch the orbital vehicle, the first stage takes off like a
normal HSCT and accelerates to Mach 3.  At that point the turbofans,
modified to burn catalyzed JP-7, would shut off and the ramjets,
would take over.  At Mach 5.5 the orbiter or the ELV would swing
out, ignite and proceed to orbit. Both vehicles would land like
aircraft at the conclusion of their respective missions.
   Estimated total weight of the combined configuration at takeoff
is about 1.5 M lbs, roughly equivalanet to a fully loaded An-225.
The orbiter stages weighs about 400,Klbs including 335 Klbs
of LOX and subcooled propane to power two 250 Klbs vacuum thrust
rocket engines. Propellants would be stored at 91 degrees Kelvin,
with the propane in a spherical tank mounted forward of the 15-by-
25-foot cargo bay and the two-seat orbiter crew station. LOX would
be stored aft.  Weldon and Fink claim the key to this design's
success is the structurally efficient airframe and the compact
tankage allowed by the high-density supercooled hydrocarbon fuel.
     The paper compares TSTO design to SSTO design.  They conclude
while a SSTO has a slightly lower recurring cost, a TSTO is easier,
cheaper, and less risky to develop, simpler to build, has greater
safety and mission versatility and doesn't carry the hard-to-handle
and bulky hydrogen fuel. The conlcude ""In conjunction with its major
use of airplane type engines and fuel, as well as its inherent self-
ferry capability, it is probably the system most likely to provide
as close to airline-like operations as possible with a practical
configuration, until a single stage airbreather/rocket concept can
be shown to be operationally viable.""
  
>Is this really news? Does this threaten further work on DC-?
   Weldon and others at Boeing have been working on TSTO designs for
some time.  I expect this, or a similar concept (perhaps the HTHL
SSTO they proposed for the SDIO SSTO first phase) is being re-
examined as a basis for a bid on the first phase of SpaceLifter.
   Does it threaten DC-???.  Possibly -- There is a set of on-going
studies trying straighten out the government's future space
transportation strategy.  MDC and Boeing (as well as other firms)
are providing data to a joint study team back in DC.  There are
various factions and options vying for attention -- including
shuttle upgrades, shuttle replacement (what was called the ""4-2-3""
architecture), SpaceLifter, ELV upgrades, and various advanced
vehicles (ALES, Beta, DC-??, NASP, FSTS, SSTOs of several types,
etc.)  NASA/DOD/DOT are trying to put together a coherent strategy
for future US gov't space transportation systems, and trying to
juggle near-term launch needs (like for DoD and NASA) against
medium-term needs (including commercial considerations), and against
the investment and risk of going to ""leap frog"" new technologies
like SDIO/SSTO and NASP and Beta.
   It's a heck of a problem.  The worst part of the problem isn't
that there aren't promising ideas and concepts -- there are dozens
of them -- but how they balance cost and risk versus real needs in
the near term.  They should have a draft report in mid-June, with a
final report coming by the end of the fiscal year.

As Ben says - this re-boost idea is all news to us here.  Do you know 
something we don't?  Please supply a source - it would be nice for 
the schedulers of observations to know where the thing is going to 
be.  These altitude numbers are also way off.  

My best source has: 
""Minimum ST ALTITUDE in the PMDB is:    573 Kilometers""
""Maximum ST ALTITUDE in the PMDB is:    603 Kilometers""
""Delta   ST ALTITUDE in the PMDB is:      3 Kilometers"" 

(PMDB is Proposal Management Data Base - used to schedule observations.)

Could you supply some calculations?  You might check some recent 
postings that explained that 'a small booster' as suggested does 
not now exist, so comparing the mass of something that doesn't 
exist to the mass of the OMS fuel seems impossible.  The contamination 
threat also remains.

One thing to recall.  Putting a satellite as high as possible is one thing. 
Coming back to not only that altitude, but matching the position of it in 
its orbit on a subsequent mission is another thing.  Any misalignment of the 
plane of the orbit during launch or being ahead or behind the target will 
require more fuel to adjust.  This was considered in the original deployment. 

I agree though that the demands on the crew and complexity are stupendous.  
One has to admire how much they are trying to do.

It is kind of absurd, isn't it?  Some players even want more distortion,

Then there are your hard-core Hendirx fans that want particular *types*

Even if they did, a globe at a scale that you could fit into your average room

I didn't think the bi-stem design was used so much for the retrieval as
for the ability to launch in a tight (size) STS envelope.  This is my own 
guess, based on similar designs flown on other large STS-launched s/c 
(GRO, UARS).  Also, there _might_ be some consideration given to mass 
requirements (bi-stems weight less than conventional S/A).  Finally, 
the HST arrays _do_ have the ability to be detached--remember, they're 
going to be replaced with new arrays.

However, as an ACS guy who's seen his branch management pull their
collective hair out over HST, I would voice a hearty 'yea' to using
conventional arrays over bi-stems, whenever possible.  No half hertz
flexible modes, no thermal snap, no problem.

So how much mass is saved by not burning the OMS?  That's the critical question.
My data shows that the OMS engines hold 10,900 kg of propellant.  Of that, a 
substantial fraction is going to be used for the first OMS burn, the reentry
burn and the reserve.  So Pat, tell us how much fuel the altitude change is
going to take, and how much the EDO pallet, BUS-1 and extra parts are going
mass.  If you can make the numbers work out, _then_ I'll be interested.  After
you show us that it can be done, then tell us how much the EDO pallet, BUS-1
and extra equipment is going to cost.

First, while astronauts certainly have done EVAs with minimal planning, that was
because they _had_ to.  They don't like to do that as a general rule.

Second, remember why they had to improvise during Intelsat 6?  They were trying
to attach a motor to a piece of hardware that wasn't designed to do that.  
Trying to shortcut the training is only going to make a repeat more likely.

Third, they don't have eight months.  They have however much time is left 
after someone comes up with a plan, shows it can work and gets it approved.
You may think I have a pessimistic attitude.  I think it's realistic.  I'm not
saying that the engineering task is impossible (few engineering tasks are).  
What I'm saying is that this is neither cost effective nor feasible under NASA
management.

No Pat.  That's $500 million minus the cost of the new hardware, minus the cost

costs, minus extra operating costs.  TANSTAAFL.

Pat, not only is this messy and less reliable than a device that's _made_ to 
perform this task, it also ignores the point.  There is a desire to have 
astronauts available so that if the door fails to open, something can be done
about it.  Unless you can provide a very reliable way of reopening the door,
you haven't solved the problem.

I can't see the need for a single (big? expensive? heavy?) ""mothership"" except
for Voyager style flyby missions. A few years ago, I did some calculations on a
""Grand Tour"" space probe launched by a Saturn V in 1975-76. At the time,I felt 
that
the idea of a big ""mother ship"" had some merit - the Voyagers had to be rather
small, lightweight craft due to the limitations imposed by using weak Titan
III/Centaur launchers. The concept I examined (and Michael's?) had a lot in
common with the British Interplanetary Society's Daedalus project for sending a
probe to Barnard's Star - i.e. a large ""bus"" spacecraft carrying several
smaller probes to be dispatched when the ship arrives at its destination.
The Saturn V supposedly would have been able to launch a 10-ton payload towards
Jupiter and beyond. The ""bus"" could have included far more powerful
cameras/telescopes/scientific equipment and a heavier/more powerful power
source than the Voyagers as there would be no limitations on weight anymore.
Extremely important as the Voyagers had to perform most of their measurements
within a couple of weeks before and after planetary encounter, and usually at a
relatively great distance.
---
The smaller probes carried aboard might have been based on the ""real"" Voyagers,
and an even smaller version like the one scheduled for launch towards Pluto in
the early 21st century, and would have been released at various points during
the mission. The advantages are obvious: the bus would have carried out the
same basic Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus-Neptune mission than Voyager 2 did, but in
addition two ""sub-probes"" could have been relased at Saturn, examining
that planet's south polar regions before moving on to Pluto. This would have
enabled NASA to map both hemispheres of Pluto/Charon by 1986...and several
other probes could have examined parts of the Jupiter/Saturn/Uranus/Neptune
systems that weren't examined in great detail by the Voyagers due to
trajectory-related factors. A small ""swarm"" of camera-equipped miniature space
probes released a month before encounter would have been too costly for a 
small Voyager-type mission but entirely feasible if launched from a heavy, 
well-equipped spacecraft. And would we have learned a lot more about the outer
planets! The reason why the Grand Tour was cancelled was lack of money, of
course.

I'd hardly call the current Pluto Fast Flyby proposal ""too large"" (if the
new technology insertion currently taking place succeeds, the S/C mass will
drop to 110-120 kg) or ""too expensive"" ($400 million [FY92 $] for two S/C),
especially when compared to other NASA planetary missions.

This proposal would work only if your various targets are relaively nearby and
the require minimal delta-v from the mother ship.  A mission to the main belt
might be one possibility for such a mission -- I recall a paper being presented
at an AIAA deisgn conference in Irvine in February where such a proposed
spacecraft was designed by some grad students at UT Austin (I think).  Four
mini-spacecraft would detatch from the main S/C, each visiting a seperate
asteroid and then returning to the main S/C.  After analysis, the main S/C
would then be targeted for the most ""interesting"" object for further study.

Now, if I could only *find* that paper...  =)

Of course,

	How many government projects after Using PERT, GANT, C.P.M.s
Process flow diagrams,  Level 5 software projects....  actually
come in on schedule and under Cost.  I know the GAO determined
that 80% of all NASA projects  miss their budgets due to failing
to adequately measure  engineering developement costs.   

Me, I am allin favor of Government R&D.  I thought Bell Labs was one of the best 
to do research.   I don't think the government should pour money
into any one sector,  but should engage in projects which naturally
push the state of the art.  

THings like  High tech  construction projects,  apollo  was worth it for the doing.  Running hte national labs.  The SSC is grossly overweight,  but
is a reasonable project at a lower cost.  

Unfortunately support for solo investigators is direly neglected.

Maybe what they should do, is throw out much of the process and just tell
new PH'ds,  you get a 1 time grant of $50,000.00   If you produce, you
can  qualify for other grants.  If you don't  you never get in again.

THis way  young people get a shot at  reserach,  and older  stale

Often Shuttle lifts satellites with upper stages. Yet we still consider it
payload. Ten Saturn flights over about 4 years delivered to LEO roughly the
same as 50 shuttle flights over 10 years.

They where pretty much the same in terms of cost/pound. A resurected
Saturn would cost only $2,000 per pound (if development costs are ignored)
which is five times cheaper than Shuttle.

Well, there is an archive of portraits in xfaces format at

It is interesting to note in the past few days' correspondance that some
believe that poor old New Mexico is not capable of hosting a commercial
space launch business.  For many reasons, it can, and we here on the front
lines see no reason why it should not.  The 'spaceport political publicity'
referred to the other day had its intended effect - the state of New Mexico
did establish the start of the necessary government infrastructure to back a
commercial space port.  The commanding general at WSMR is in full support of
dual-use for the facilities.  The WSMR location also has some strategic
advantages in the form of necessary infrastructure and controlled air space
to support the project.  Just because the folks involved have not done the
traditional aerospace-equivalent of vapor-ware by inviting folks out to kick
non-existent tires but have been merely doing their job to prepare for
launch, don't think that nothing has happened.  From my interactions with
the MACDAC folks, I get the impression that they want to set a firm,
believable launch date based on vehicle readiness and not just some fiction
to plug a space on a calendar.  I believe that all will happen this summer
and don't worry, the locals here are planning to let everyone know when it
does occur.

I don't think that idea means what you think it does. Having everyone

It's a moot point: Step out of your door go _anywhere_ (except possibly

While I'm sure Sagan considers it sacrilegious, that wouldn't be
because of his doubtfull credibility as an astronomer. Modern, 
ground-based, visible light astronomy (what these proposed
orbiting billboards would upset) is already a dying field: The
opacity and distortions caused by the atmosphere itself have
driven most of the field to use radio, far infrared or space-based
telescopes. In any case, a bright point of light passing through
the field doesn't ruin observations. If that were the case, the
thousands of existing satellites would have already done so (satelliets
might not seem so bright to the eyes, but as far as astronomy is concerned,
they are extremely bright.)

Nowadays, usually with a computer. No theory predicted the numeric 
discoveries listed above. No one can yet write an algorithm that will
predict the precise behavior of any of these at any precise level of
their evolution. So it remains for experimenters to gather data on their

Tell that to the people who run the 10-meter Keck telescope, or the 
astronomers and engineers working on the Gemini twin 8-meter telescope
project.  It took 7 years to build Keck I and now they are building
Keck II.  According to the December 1992 Sky & Telescope, ""This
second 10-meter eye will convert the facility into a binocular telescope
with double the light-gathering power and the ability to resolve
the headlights of a car some 25,000 kilometers away.""   Japan's 8.3-meter
Subaru telescope will soon join Keck on Mauna Kea.  All these telescopes
will work in the infrared, yes, but they are _visible light_ telescopes!

And haven't you heard anything about adaptive optics?  A lot of research
was done with ""Star Wars"" funding, and some is now being shared with
astronomers.  This shows great promise.  Soon, probably within a few
years, even the largest telescopes will be able to resolve to their 
theoretical limit _despite_ the distortions of the atmosphere.

To say that ""visible light astronomy is already a dying field"" is 
pure hokum.  To use the ""logic"" that things are already bad, so it doesn't
matter if it gets worse is absurd.  Maybe common sense and logic
are the dying fields.

From the description I've read, it's prob. only going to be
as bright as Jupiter. Anything else is probably hype from the
opponents or wishful thinking from the sponsors.

If we could do something as bright as the full moon that soon,
that cheap, the CIS would have done it already.

Ahh, perhaps that's why we've (astronomers) have just built *2* 10-meter
ground-based scopes and are studying designs for larger ones.
Seriously, though, you're never going to get a 10-meter scope into orbit
as cheaply as you can build one on the ground, and with adaptive optics
and a good site, the difference in quality is narrowed quite a bit
anyway.  Also, scopes in low orbit (like Hubble) can only observe things
continuously for ~45 minutes at a time, which can be a serious
limitation.

I sure as hell does if the 'point of light' is half a degree in extent
and as bright as the moon.  Have you ever noticed how much brighter the
night sky is on a moonlit night?

Existing satellites *are* points of light, but an advertising sign that
appeared as a point would be useless, so I rather think these will
appear larger than a 'typical' satellite.  Also, satellite tracks *are*
ruining lots of plates in the current Palomar Sky Survey.

For some reasons we humans think that it is our place to control

the most blatant example yet of our disregard for the fact that we are

 That doesn't seem like a fair comparison.  Infrared astronomy 
 didn't really get started until something like 25 yrs. ago; it
 didn't explode until IRAS in 1983.  Gamma-ray (and I think 
 X-ray) observations didn't really get started until the '70s.
 I believe the same is true of ultraviolet observations in 
 general, and I know that extreme UV (short of 1000 Angstroms)
 observations, until the EUVE (launched last year) had almost 
 no history except a few observations on Skylab in the '70s.

 Twenty-five years ago, the vast majority of astronomers only 
 had access to optical or radio instruments.  Now, with far more
 instruments available, growth in some of these new fields has
 resulted in optical work representing a smaller fraction of 
 total astronomical work.

 Hmm, some of the folks in this department planning on using 
 adaptive optics at the 5 m at Palomar for near-infrared 
 observations (1 and 2 microns) might be surprised to hear this.

 And isn't the NTT already pushing toward 0.1 arcsecond resolution, 
 from a ground-based site (remember 0.1 arcseconds was one of the 
 selling points of HST).

I believe that this orbiting space junk will be FAR brighter still;
more like the full moon.  The moon upsets deep-sky observation all
over the sky (and not just looking at it) because of scattered light.

This is a known problem, but of course two weeks out of every four are
OK.  What happens when this billboard circles every 90 minutes?  What
would be a good time then?

   . . . David gives good explaination of the deductions from the isotropic,
   'edged' distribution, to whit, they are either part of the Universe or
   part of the Oort cloud.

   Why couldn't they be Earth centred, with the edge occuring at the edge
   of the gravisphere? I know there isn't any mechanism for them, but there
   isn't a mechanism for the others either.

What on Earth is the ""gravisphere""?
Anyway, before it's decay the Pioneer Venus Orbiter
had a gamma ray detector, as does Ulysses, they 
detect the brightest bursts that the Earth orbit detectors
do, so the bursts are at least at Oort cloud distances.
In principle four detectors spaced out by a few AU would
see parallax if the bursts are of solar system origin.

_The_ problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutely
no plausible mechanism has been proposed. It would have
to involve new physics as far as I can tell. Closest to
""conventional"" Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching
by comets, it's got too many holes in it to count, but at
least it was a good try...

  Yesterday, I went to the Boeing shareholders meeting.  It was a bit shorter
than I expected.  Last year (when the stock was first down), they made a big
presentation on the 777, and other programs.  This year, it was much more
bare-bones.

In any case, I wanted to ask a question that the board of directors would
hear, and so I got there early, and figured that If I didn't get to the mike,
maybe they would read mine off of a card, and so I wrote it down, and handed it
in.

After the meeting started, Mr. Shrontz said that he would only answer written
questions, in order to be fair to the people in the overflow room that only
had monitors downstairs.  Naturally, I was crushed.

So, when question and answer time came, I was suprised to find my question
being read and answered.  Admittedly near the end of the ones that he took.
Presumably getting there early, and getting the question in early made all
the difference.

So, on to the substance. The question was 

Is Boeing looking at anything BEYOND the high speed Civil Transport, such
as a commercial space launch system, and if not, how will Boeing compete
with the reusable single stage to orbit technology presently being developed
by Mcdonnell Douglass?

Well, he read it without a hitch, and without editing, with impressed me,
then he answered it very quickly treating it as a two part question, last
part first.

This is to the best of my recollection what he said.

As far as single stage to orbit technology, we think that we have a better
answer in a two stage approach, and we are talking to some of our customers 
about that.  As far as commercialization, that is a long ways off.  The High
speed Civil Transport is about as far out as our commercial planning goes at
this point.

So, this tells me that Boeing still considers space to be a non-commercial
arena, and for the most part this is true, however it also tells me that 
they consider there to be enough money in building space launchers for them
to persue work on their own.

Now, I do have a friend on the spacelifter program at boeing.  Actually,
this is a mis-nomer, as there is no spacelifter contract for the work that this
guy is doing, however, he is doing work in preparation of a proposal for space
lifter contracts.  He won't tell me what he is doing, but maybe this is where
the TSTO action is taking place at boeing.  At the very minimum, the chairman
of the board of boeing said that they have an approach in mind, and they are
trying to do something with it.  

Anybody know anything further?
Is this really news?
Does this threaten further work on DC-? ?

                    John.

It's not quite what you were asking, but a few years ago I helped some EE
remote sensing people run some experiments on the microwave emmissivity of
ice; they used the sky for a background calibration source.  They said that
from Earth's surface the sky looks like a 60K blackbody.

Wouldn't bother me.  I'd laugh.  It wouldn't work -- the surface of the
Moon is *already* pretty dark, and the contrast would be so poor you
couldn't possibly see it.  The only reason the Moon looks bright is that
it's in bright sunlight against an otherwise-dark sky.  Evidently Heinlein

All legitimate power to enforce these rights derives from the consent

Fine. I'll buy from George. GEORGEEE!!!!

That assumes I can't weasel out a cooperative venture of some sort (cut me a

Unless you're Martin Marietta, since (as I recall) they bought out the GD line
of aerospace products. 

If MM/GD does it as an in-house project, their costs would look much better
than buying at ""list price.""  Does anyone REALLY know the profit margins built

Oh please.  How much of a profit do you want?  Pulling $100-150 million after
all is said and done wouldn't be too shabby.  Not to mention the other goodies
I'll collect in:

	a)  Movie & TV rights (say $100-150 million conservatively)
	b)  Advertising       (""Look Mommie, they're drinking Coke!"")
	c)  Intangibles	      (Name recognization, experience & data

If you want lean, fine.  A $500 million prize would be more than adequate for a
prize.

Maybe Wales would be kind enough to define what a company would consider
a decent profit.

If you want R&D done, you'll have to write in R&D clauses.  I suppose you could
make it a SBIR set-aside :)

      Thanks to the people who have answered here and in email to my 
question about which countries engage in space surveillance. 
Unfortunately, I apparently didn't make the meaning of the message 
clear, since most replies have addressed satellite reconnaissance, 
rather than space surveillance 

     What I meant was _not_ which countries use satellites to look at 
the Earth (satellite reconnaissance) , but _was_ which countries have 
programs to detect and track (i.e., determine the orbital elements of) 
satellites as they pass overhead (space surveillance). 

    The US uses missile-defense radars, supplemented by a fascinating 
quasi-radar operated by the Navy, to do this for satellites in LEO, and 
electrooptical systems for objects at altitudes above 5,000 km or so. 
The FEE, I understand, does much the same thing. 

    Amateur satellite observers use eyeballs, binoculars, stopwatches 
and PCs for objects out to around 1500 km, enabling them to keep track 
of satellites for which, ah, official element sets aren't available. 
See the fascinating books by Desmond King-Hele for details, as well as 
the files in the molczan directory on kilroy.jpl.nasa.gov.  The 
material posted in my previous message suggests that Japan engages in 
optical and radar space surveillance to a modest degree, and it may be 
that other countries do also. 

    Which was the question I meant to ask: who are they, how do they do 
it, and why do they do it?

          ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North 
          Pacific Publishers, Portland, Oregon, 456 pages, indexed, 
          hardcover. 
          

               ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"" contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to 
          most ALL astrophysical mysteries. 
          
               This book is Volume III of a revised and enlarged 
          edition of ""THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE"", 1959.  
          Volume I is ""NOTHING BUT MOTION"" (1979), and Volume II is 
          ""THE BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER"" (1988). 
          
               Most books and journal articles on the subject of 
          astrophysics are bristling with integrals, partial 
          differentials, and other FANCY MATHEMATICS.  In this book, by 
          contrast, mathematics is conspicuous by its absence, except 
          for some relatively simple formulas imbedded in the text.  
          Larson emphasizes CONCEPTS and declares that mathematical 
          agreement with a theory does NOT guarantee its conceptual 
          validity. 
          
               Dewey B. Larson was a retired engineer with a Bachelor 
          of Science Degree in Engineering Science from Oregon State 
          University.  He developed the Theory described in his books 
          while trying to find a way to MATHEMATICALLY CALCULATE the 
          properties of chemical compounds based ONLY on the elements 
          they contain. 
          
               ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"" describes the astrophysical 
          portions of Larson's CONSISTENT, INTEGRATED, COMPREHENSIVE, 
          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, a kind of 
          ""grand unified field theory"" that orthodox physicists and 
          astro-physicists CLAIM to be looking for.  It is built on two 
          postulates about the physical and mathematical nature of 
          space and time: 
          
               (1) The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE 
          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE 
          units, and with two RECIPROCAL aspects, SPACE and TIME. 
          
               (2) The physical universe conforms to the relations of 
          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its primary magnitudes are 
          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN. 
          
               From these two postulates, Larson was able to build a 
          COMPLETE theoretical universe, from photons and subatomic 
          particles to the giant elliptical galaxies, by combining the 
          concept of INWARD AND OUTWARD SCALAR MOTIONS with 
          translational, vibrational, rotational, and rotational-
          vibrational motions.  At each step in the development, he was 
          able to match parts of his theoretical universe with 
          corresponding parts in the real physical universe, including 
          EVEN THINGS NOT YET DISCOVERED.  For example, in his 1959 
          book, he first predicted the existence of EXPLODING GALAXIES, 
          several years BEFORE astronomers started finding them.  They 
          are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of his comprehensive Theory.  And 
          when quasars were discovered, he had a related explanation 
          ready for those also. 
          
               As a result of his theory, which he called ""THE 
          RECIPROCAL SYSTEM"", Larson TOTALLY REJECTED many of the 
          sacred doctrines of orthodox physicists and astrophysicists, 
          including black holes, neutron stars, degenerate matter, 
          quantum wave mechanics (as applied to atomic structure), 
          ""nuclear"" physics, general relativity, relativistic mass 
          increases, relativistic Doppler shifts, nuclear fusion in 
          stars, and the big bang, all of which he considered to be 
          nothing more than MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES.  He was very 
          critical of the AD HOC assumptions, uncertainty principles, 
          solutions in principle, ""no other way"" declarations, etc., 
          used to maintain them. 
          
               ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"" is divided into 31 chapters.  
          It begins with a description of how galaxies are built from 
          the gravitational attraction between globular star clusters, 
          which are formed from intergalactic gas and dust clouds that 
          accumulate from the decay products of cosmic rays coming in 
          from the ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe.  (Galaxy 
          formation from the MYTHICAL ""big bang"" is a big mystery to 
          orthodox astronomers.)  He then goes on to describe life 
          cycles of stars and how binary and multiple star systems and 
          solar systems result from Type I supernova explosions of 
          SINGLE stars. 
          
               Several chapters are devoted to quasars which, according 
          to Larson, are densely-packed clusters of stars that have 
          been ejected from the central bulges of exploding galaxies 
          and are actually traveling FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT 
          (although most of that speed is AWAY FROM US IN TIME). 
          
               Astronomers and astrophysicists who run up against 
          observations that contradict their theories would find 
          Larson's explanations quite valuable if considered with an 
          OPEN MIND.  For example, they used to believe that GAMMA RAY 
          BURSTS originated from pulsars, which exist primarily in the 
          plane or central bulge of our galaxy.  But the new gamma ray 
          telescope in earth orbit observed that the bursts come from 
          ALL DIRECTIONS UNIFORMLY and do NOT correspond with any 
          visible objects, (except for a few cases of directional 
          coincidence).  Larson's explanation is that the gamma ray 
          bursts originate from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the ANTI-MATTER 
          HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls the ""cosmic 
          sector"".  Because the anti-matter universe exists in a 
          RECIPROCAL RELATION to our material universe, with the speed 
          of light as the BOUNDARY between them, and has THREE 
          dimensions of time and ONLY ONE dimension of space, the 
          bursts can pop into our material universe ANYWHERE seemingly 
          at random. 
          
               Larson heavily quotes or paraphrases statements from 
          books, journal articles, and leading physicists and 
          astronomers.  In this book, 351 of them are superscripted 
          with numbers identifying entries in the reference list at the 
          end of the book.  For example, a quote from the book 
          ""Astronomy: The Cosmic Journey"", by William K. Hartmann, 
          says, ""Our hopes of understanding all stars would brighten if 
          we could explain exactly how binary and multiple stars 
          form.... Unfortunately we cannot.""  Larson's book contains 
          LOGICAL CONSISTENT EXPLANATIONS of such mysteries that are 
          WORTHY OF SERIOUS CONSIDERATION by ALL physicists, 
          astronomers, and astrophysicists.

So, having seen Henry's encouraging statement about starting to talk
about it; I shall.

I feel that we as a community of people have unique resources
to deliver to the world a comprehensive book which can elaborate
on the utility of spaceflight to fields which are as divergent 
as medical intensive care, agriculture, environmental protection, and 
probably more.  I do not believe that the general public understands
the impact of spaceflight on the whole of society.  In the absence
of such knowledge, we see dwindling support of the world's space effort.

I believe that we as a group have the responsibility to not only
communicate amongst ourselves, but also with others through print media.

A well-orchestrated and technically oriented analysis of life science
variables required to support long-duration spaceflight (like long
expenditions to the moon or Mars) would be entertaining and educational
to the general public.  The objective of such an effort would be to 
compile resources and publications from accepted scientific and technical
journals which would address each major life science area.  In addition,
ideas for further research and development could be put forward for
the general public to ponder...allowing the general public to take
part in the excitement of exploration.

Individuals interested should be willing to devote an hour per week
to running literature searches and finding journal articles.  In addition,
we need to obtain the assistance of personnel from within the halls
of NASA and industry.

I have appreciated the positive responses to date and I am personally
eager to start this project.  Perhaps we could start with debate regarding
how best to grade the viability of various technologies for application
to spaceflight.

Well, I'll avoid your question for now (got some learnin' to do) with a
promise to come back with more info when I can find it.  I _do_ know that
BATSE is the primary instrument in the development of the all-sky map of
long-term sources.  Given that fact, and the spacecraft attitude knowledge
of approx. 2 arcmin, we might be able to figure out how well BATSE can
determine the location (rotational) of a Gamma Ray burster from knowledge
of the all-sky map's accuracy.  PR material for the other three instruments
give accuracies on the order of ""fractions of a degree"", if that's 
any help.

Speaking of GRO, the net-world probably was happy to see that the preps
for orbit adjust appear to be going well.  Our branch guy who's helping
out says that things have gone smoothly with the iso-valve preps and the
burns will take place in mid-June.

Anyway, I'm off to find out more.  'Be back when I get some info.

        Batse alone isn't always used to determine position.  WHen a
particularly bright burst occurs, There are a couple of other detectors that
catch it going off.  Pioneer 10 or 11 is the one I'm getting at here.  This
puppy is far enough away, that if a bright burst happens nearby, the huge
annulus created by it will hopefully intersect the line or general circle given
by BATSE, and we can get a moderately accurate position. Say oh, 2 or 3
degrees. That is the closest anyone has ever gotten with it.  
        Actually, my advisor, another classmate of mine, and me were talking
the other day about putting just one detector on one of the Pluto satellites. 
THen we realized that the satellite alone is only carrying something like 200
pounds of eq.  Well, a BATSE detector needs lead shielding to protect it, and 1
alone weighs about 200 pounds itself.

        We decided against it.

Actually, both numbers are correct.  The difference is in the direction
of the acceleration.  For pilots, accelerations tend to be transverse to
the direction you're facing (pulling out from a steep dive, the
acceleration will force blood toward your feet, for instance).  In this
case, you can only put up with about 8 g's even with a pressure suit.  

The record for acceleration, though, is measured along ""the direction
you're facing"" (for lack of a better term).  As I recall, this record
was set in rocket sleds back in the 60's -- and was about 40 g's or so.

   Henry, if I read you correctly, you may be asking ""If I put a blackbody
in interstellar space ('disregarding the Sun and nearby large warm objects'),
what termperature will it reach in thermal equilibrium with the ambient
radiation field?""

   If that's the case, let me point out that interstellar dust and 
molecules provide many instances of things that are, well, not-too-far
from being blackbodies.  Many different observations, including IRAS
and COBE, have determined that interstellar dust grain temperatures
can range from 40K to 150K.  You might look in a conference proceedings
""Interstellar Processes"", ed. D. J. Hollenbach and H. A. Thronson, Jr.,
published in 1987.  Try the articles by Tielens et al., Seab, and 
Black.

   Inside the disk of the galaxy, the temperature varies quite a bit
from place to place (how close are you to the nearest OB association,
I would guess).  Outside the galaxy, of course, things aren't so 
varied.

   I hope this is what you were looking for....

I don't think touting contributions is a good idea.  World War II produced
many many beneficial spinoffs.  Eg. Radar, jet aeroplanes, rocket technology.
I don't think anyone would argue that World War II was, in and of itself,

Do we attach some meaning of the Israelites entering ""the promised land"" to 
Christianity?

   I submit God did not hold the children responsible when the adults chose 
to follow the bad report of the 10 spies over Joshua and Caleb.  This is 
recorded for us in Deuteronomy 1:39 ""Moreover your little ones, which ye said 
should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge 
between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give 
it, and they shall possess it.""

   At least to me it seems there was/is an age, or point in maturity where 
they were/are held responsible, and could not enter the ""Promised Land"", 
younger ones were not held to the same ""rules"", at least not by God.

A priest I know gave me an interesting explanation.  He said that the
words of Mary point not to doubt or troubled thoughts, but rather to
complete humbleness.  Those who are humble and do not revel in
themselves frequently are confused when given high praise about
themselves, as Mary would rightly be.

	Often times (most recently on this list in the last few days) I've

	""...whoever adds to the sacred words of this book...whoever removes

	 used as an arguement against the deutercanonical books.

	 I feel this is ridiculous for two reasons:

	 1.  They weren't added later by the Catholic Church; they were
		*always* part of what was considered inspired scripture.
		(This has been dealt with in previous postings...no reason
		to repeat the info.)

	2.  It is more likely than not that when St. John (or whomever) wrote
		the book of Revelation WHAT WAS THEN CONSIDERED SCRIPTURE was
		** NOT ** the same thing you and I are holding in our hands!

	If one takes the translation of ""this book"" in REV 18:22 (or somewhere
	around there) to mean ""all of scripture"", then all of us are likely
	holding something that is in violation of this command.

	It is impossible to exactly date the scriptures, even the N.T. ones
	(they didn't like to date their letters, I guess).  I really wish I
	had my bible with me right now to get the facts straight, but I believe
	that several of the N.T. letters, chief among them 2 Peter, have their
	most likely date of composition in the early second century A.D.
		Revelation was almost certainly written durin the reign of 
	Domition (sp?), A.D. 80-96.  Thus it could be argues that we are all
	in sin if we accept 2 Peter as scripture, since it was ""added"" to the

In the Hebrew of Genesis 3:15, the gender is clearly masculine.

The Latin has feminine forms, only by an accident of grammar.

Andrew stated that KECHARITOMENE means not just ""full of grace"" but
""having a plenitude or perfection of grace."" The word is used
elsewhere in the New Testament only in Ephesians 1:6

 + Unto the praise of the glory of his grace, in which he hath
 + GRACED us in his beloved Son. (Rheims-Douay translation)

I cannot find any indication in my dictionary that the verb implies
anything as strong as Andrew suggests, nor does the Ephesians
passage suggest that the verb means ""to preserve from any taint of
original or actual sin from the first moment of existence."" I should
like to see a comment on the meaning of the verb, preferably not
from s writer who is discussing Luke 1:28 at the moment.

Subject: Jacob and Esau

Gerry Palo wrote that there is nothing in Christianity that excludes
the theory of a succession of lives.

I wrote that the Apostle Paul, in Romans 9, speaks of God as
choosing Jacob over Esau, and adds that this is not as a result of
anything that either child had done, since they had not been born
yet.

Clearly, Paul does not believe that they had had previous lives, nor
does he suppose that his readers will believe it. For if they had
had previous lives, it would not make sense to say, ""Neither of them
has done anything good or bad as yet, since they are not yet born.""

Daniel Cossack writes to ask whether it is fair for God to hate
Easau when Esau has done nothing bad?

I reply that in Hebrew it is standard usage to speak of hating when
what is meant is simply putting in second place. As an example,
consider the saying in Matthew 6:24

 + No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one
 + and love the other, or....

Now, it is obviously false that a man with two masters must hate one
of them. But it is obviously true that he must put one of them in
second place. A dog that always comes when either Billy or Bobby
calls will have a problem if they stand in different places and call
simultaneously. It cannot give first priority to both. One must take
second place. In our original example, second place means that
Jacob, not Esau, is chosen to bear the covenant blessing and
obligation, and to be the ancestor of Christ.

Eugene Bigelow mentions Matthew 11:14 which says of John the
Baptist:

 + And if ye will receive it, this is ELijah, who was to come.

I take this to mean that John was an Elijah-like figure, dressing
and living like Elijah, preaching like Elijah, and fulfilling the
prediction that Elijah would prepare the way for the Messiah.  I do
not think that he was Elijah in a literal sense, and, appareently,
neither did he (John 1:21).

This is a RFD on a proposal for a newsgroup which would promote a 
sharing on the ""Johannine hours"" as proposed each month by the monks of 
the ecumenical community of Taize (pronounced te-zay) in France.

NAME OF PROPOSED NEWSGROUP: 
==========================

soc.religion.taize (Unmoderated)


PURPOSE OF THE GROUP: 
====================

The Taize Community is an international ecumenical community of monks 
based in France. Many young adults come there to search for meaning in 
their life and to deepen their understanding of their faith through a 
sharing with others. This newsgroup will allow such a sharing through a 
monthly ""Johannine Hour"" which will be posted at the beginning of each 
month. A ""Johannine hour"" involves a short commentary on a given Bible 
passage, followed by some questions for reflection.  Any thoughts that 
may arise in consequence and that you wish to share with others can be 
posted here. We are not interested in theological debate, and even less 
in polemics. No expertise is required! The idea is to help one another 
to deepen our understanding of Scripture as it is related to our own 
life-journey.

The idea of ""Johannine hours"" was born in Taize as a simple response
to all those who were trying to assimilate the Bible's message in the
midst of their daily life. Because of work or studies, it is often
impossible to spend long hours in silence and reflection, but
everyone can take an hour from time to time to enter a church, sit
quietly at home or go out for a walk in the woods. There, in silence,
we can meditate on a passage of Scripture to listen to the voice of
Christ.

During the time of silence, it is important to concentrate on what we 
understand and not waste time worrying if, in some Biblical expressions, 
we find it difficult to hear the voice of Christ. The idea is to 
communicate to others what we have understood of Christ, not burdening 
them with our own hesitations but rather telling them what has brought 
us joy, what has led us to run the risk of trusting more deeply.

Perhaps those who read and think about the ""Johannine Hours"" in this
newsgroup could share their reflections and discoveries with others.

The important thing is the complementarity between two aspects, the
personal aspect of silent, personal reflection and the communal aspect
of sharing, which through Usenet makes us a part of a worldwide network.

BACKGROUND OF THE TAIZE COMMUNITY:
=================================

The following provides some background information on the life and
vocation of the Taize (pronounced te-zay) community.

""A PARABLE OF COMMUNION"": August 1940, with Europe in the grip of
World War II, Brother Roger, aged 25, set up home in the almost
abandoned village of Taize, in Eastern France. His dream: to bring
together a monastic community which would live out ""a parable of
community"", a sign of reconciliation in the midst of the distress of
the time. Centering his life on prayer, he used his house to conceal
refugees, especially Jews fleeing from the Nazi occupation.

AN INTERNATIONAL AND ECUMENICAL COMMUNITY: Taize's founder spent the
first two years alone. Others joined him later and at Easter 1949,
seven brothers committed themselves together to common life and
celibacy. Year by year, still others have entered the community, each
one making a lifelong commitment after several years of preparation.
Today, there are 90 brothers, Catholics and from various Protestant
backgrounds, from over twenty different countries. Some of them are
living in small groups in poor neighbourhoods in Asia, Africa, North
and South America. The brothers accept no donations or gifts for
themselves, not even family inheritances, and the community holds no
capital. The brothers earn their living and share with others
entirely through their own work. In 1966, Sisters of Saint Andrew, an
international Catholic community founded 750 years ago, came to live
in the neighbouring village, to share the responsibility of welcoming
people in Taize.

TAIZE AND THE YOUNG; THE INTERCONTINENTAL MEETINGS: Young adults, and
less young, have been coming to Taize in ever greater numbers since
1957. Hundreds of thousands of people from Europe and far beyond have
thus been brought together in a common search. Intercontinental
meetings take place each week, Sunday to Sunday, throughout the year
and they include youth from between 35 and 60 countries during any
one week. The meetings give each person the opportunity to explore
the roots of their faith and to reflect on how to unite the inner
life and human solidarity. The meetings in summer can have up to
6,000 participants a week. Three times every day, the brothers and
everybody on the hill come together for common prayer in the Church
of Reconciliation, built in 1962 when the village church became too
small.

""A PILGRIMAGE OF TRUST ON EARTH"" The community has never wanted to
create a ""movement"" around itself. Instead, people are called to
commit themselves in their church at home, in their neighbourhood,
their city or village. To support them in this, Taize has created
what it calls ""a pilgrimage of trust on earth"". At the end of each
year, the pilgrimage has a ""European meeting"" which brings together
tens of thousands of young adults from every part of Europe for
several days in a major city. There have also been meetings in Asia
and in the United States. Every year, Brother Roger writes an open
letter to the young. Usually completed during a stay in one of the
poor regions of the world, these are translated into thirty languages
and provide themes for reflexion for the following year.

NOTE:  Discussion on the creation of this newsgroup will take place in 
       news.groups.

I'd like to field this one, if I may.  Although I am a believer in and follower
of Christ, my experiences with religion haven't been all that positive.  In
fact, there was one point in my life when, for about three days, I simply
_couldn't_ believe in the existence of God.  Anyway, when I look back upon the
troubles I've had, they seem to fall into two categories -- impulses to
unbelief that resulted from logical contradictions, and impulses to unbelief
that resulted from frustration with God.

The first category doesn't occur to me much anymore, as I have worked through
most of the arguments for the non-existence of God.  But way back when, these
would cause me some problems, and I would have to struggle with my faith to
continue to believe.  I can see where others less stubborn than I (and I do
mean stubborn.  Stubborness has often been the only thing standing between
me an atheism from time to time) would fail.

The second category arises out of some long-term personal difficulties and
the struggle to live my life as God would have me live it WITHOUT living my 
life as others would tell me how God would have me live it.  A good example of
this is my struggle with the more radical Christians I meet.  I am not, nor
have I ever been, ""on fire for Chirst,"" and I don't think I ever want to be.
Nevertheless, I am not ""lukewarm"" about my faith, so I don't really
fit in with the mainstream either.  Quite naturally, I feel a lot of anxiety
about my dislocation within Christian society, and it can lead to a lot of
internal tension, when I want to do what I _know_ is right,
but when another part of me believes that what I want to do is wrong because
all the other Christians think so to.  Quite naturally, this tension has a
destructive effect on my relationship with God, and during all of this internal
strife, there's atheism sitting there like the promised land -- no rules, no
responsibilities, no need to live up to anyone's expectations but my own.
Complete freedom.  Of course, it's all an illusion, but nevertheless, it's a
very appealing illusion, especially when the so-called ""people of God"" are
behaving like total twits.  I can easily understand why someone would go
that route, and would be hostile to ever coming back.

IMHO, many of the former-Christians-turned-atheists-who-are-now-actively-
hostile-to-Christianity are so because their experience with Christ and God
wasn't a very peaceful one, but one of mind-control and ""shut-up-and-do-what-
you're-told-because-we-know-what's-best-for-you-because-it's-God's-will-and-
you're-to-young-to-know-what-God's-will-is-yet"" courtesy of some of Christ's
more overzealous followers.  

A final reason why people become atheists is because Christians do not have a
very good reputation right now.  One of the things that attracted people to
Christianity in the ancient days was the love that Christians obviously had
for one another and the world around them.  Unlike the rest of the world,
Christian communities actively cared for their poor, and the Christian rich
did not trod on the backs of their poorer brothers, but bent down to help
them.  Christians were known for living exemplary lives, even if they were
thought to be traitors to the state because they wouldn't sacrifice to the
emporer.  Nowadays, courtesy of the media and some Christian leaders who lost
Christ on their way to power, people see Christians as sexually-repressed
hippocritical busibodies who want to remake society into a facist version of 
their own moral view.

There are a lot more reasons why people become atheists, but I don't have time
to go into them right now.

I wrote that I thought that 2 Peter 1:20 meant, ""no prophecy of

Tony Zamora replies (Sat 8 May 1993) that this in turn implies that
it is not subject to the private interpretation of the reader
either. I am not sure that I understand this.
     In one sense, no statement by another is subject to my private
interpretation. If reliable historians tell me that the Athenians
lost the Pelopennesian War, I cannot simply interpret this away
because I wanted the Athenians to win. Facts are facts and do not go
away because I want them to be otherwise.
     In another sense, every statement is subject to private
interpretation, in that I have to depend on my brains and
expereience to decide what it means, and whether it is sufficiently
well attested to merit my assent. Even if the statement occurs in an
inspired writing, I still have to decide, using my own best
judgement, whether it is in fact inspired. This is not arrogance --
it is just an inescapable fact.

   This is no less logical than the assumption that if something is
_not_ in the Bible, then it _must not_ be done.  But I don't really
think that's what he's saying anyway.  See below.

   What about the letter to Philemon?  In it Paul at least hints that a
certain slave be released.  Also, slavery in those times was not the
same as the type of slavery we had in the U.S.  I think a better
comparison would be to indentured servitude.  I don't really want to get
into a discussion on slavery.  Anyway, although it does demonstrate your
point, I don't think it is relevent, because the original poster did not
say that absence of specific condemenation proves something is not
immoral.

   Back to the original poster's assertion.  He is not in fact making
the logical error of which you accuse him.  He stated the fact that the
Bible does not say that babies cannot be baptized.  Also, we know that
the Bible says that _everyone_ must be baptized to enter Heaven.
_Everyone_ includes infants, unless there is other Scripture to the
contrary, i.e. an exception.  Since there is no exception listed in the
Bible, we must assume (to be on the safe side) that the Bible means what
it says, that _everyone_ must be baptized to enter Heaven.  And so we
baptize infants.

   To summarize, you accused the original poster of saying if something
is not forbidden by the Bible, then that proves it is OK; i.e. if
something cannot be disproven, it is true.  He rather seemed to be
asserting that since the Bible does not forbid, _you cannot prove_,
using the Bible, that it is _not_ OK.  There is a difference between
proving whether or not something can be proven or disproven (there are
theories on provability in the field of Logic, by the way) and actually
proving or disproving it.  The other logical error we must avoid falling
into is the converse: that if something cannot be proven, then it is
false.  This seems to be the error of many _sola scriptura_ believers.

   I think the only thing that can be proven here is that one cannot use
Scripture alone to prove something either way about infant Baptism,
although the evidence seems to me to favor it.

So what you're saying then, is that God exercises direct control, or
influence upon humanity. He doesn't control our every thought or action,
but takes what we do, whether it be intended for evil or not, and turns
it into something good. It seems to me, that this idea conflicts with
the belief that God gave humans FREE WILL. As far as I can determine,
it is impossible to reconcile these two different ideas. If God were to
exert his influence upon anyone or anything at anytime, he would be 
impeding upon someone's free will. Unless, of course, you believe that
God did not give us complete and unabated free will, but rather, some sort
of conditional free will. Something that allows us to make our own choices
and control our own lives except when God wants to use us to fulfill some
good purpose of his own by ""hardening our heart"" or controlling us in some
other way. I hear alot of people who look at various events, mostly 
catastrophies or things like the AIDS epidemic and make comments about
God's will. I have a very difficult time understanding why people believe
that God controls anything that happens on this planet. Except, possibly
when being asked to through someone's prayer. According to the Bible,
Pharoah was going to let Moses' people go after one or two plagues, but
God kept hardening his heart so Moses could cast all 7 plagues upon the
Egyptians, the last plague causing the death of many innocent children.
So then, God impeded upon Pharoah's free will and used him as a puppet.
God did this not just to free the Hebrews, but to free them in some sort
of a grand fashion. I suppose from the Hebrew's point of view, this could
be seen as turning something bad into good, but I'm sure the Egyptians didn't
see it this way. All of your examples of how God turned something bad into
something good are based upon showing favortism to one group of people over
another. After all, it's only good based upon your point of view. Why does
God, who is supposed to be the god of all of humanity, play favorites?

I hesitate to comment on the validity of this, because I do not know
what your friend meant by it. If he meant that whatever exists must
have been created, then he is open to the obvious retort that God
exists, and so God must have been created.

Perhaps your friend meant that we exist now but that there was a
time when we did not exist, and therefore something other than
ourselves must have brought us into existence. This seems plausible,
but an atheist might reply, ""So my parents engendered me. So what?""
Here your friend would have to explain why an infinite regress of
causes is not a satisfactory explanation. He would have some support
from philosophers who are not ordinarily considered religious (Ayn
Rand, and some others who are in the tradition of Aristotle). Having
argued for a First Cause, he would have to bridge the gap between
said entity and the God of Abraham. If he merely asserts that the

If you are referring to the terms ""effeminate"" and ""homosexuals"" in
the above passage, I agree that the accuracy of the translation has
been challenged.  However, I was simply commenting on the charge that
it is an ""incredibly perverse"" interpretation to read this as a
condemnation of homosexuality.  Such a charge seems to imply that no
reasonable person would ever conclude from the verse that Paul
intended to condemn homosexuality; however, I think I can see how a
reasonable person might very well take this view of the verse.
Therefore I do not believe it is ""incredibly perverse"" to read it in
this way.

Actually, I wasn't thinking of the church at all.  After all, a couple
doesn't have to be married by a minister.  A secular justice of the
peace could do the job, and the two people would be married.  My point
was that it is easy to find a biblical basis for heterosexual
marriage, but where in the Bible would one get a Christian marriage
between two people of the same sex?  And if you do see a biblical
basis for same-sex marriages, how willing would gay Christians be to
""save themselves"" for such a marriage and to never have sexual
intercourse with anyone outside of that marriage relationship?  Please
note that I am not trying to imply that gay Christians would not be
willing to be so monogamous, I am genuinely interested in hearing
opinions on the subject.  I have heard comments from gays in the past
that lead me to believe they regard promiscuity as one of the main
points of being homosexual, yet I tend to doubt that gays who want to
be Christian would advocate such a position.  So what is the gay view?

Maybe before Babel,everyone including angels spoke the same language,so at

Sorry, I put my foot in my mouth, concerning the church's history.
It is correct to say that the Council of Hippo 393 listed the 
deuterocanonical books among those accepted for use in the
church, and that this was ratified by the Council of Carthage,
and by Pope Innoent I and Gelasius I (414 AD).

Yet Eerdman's History of the Church says: 

""At the end of the fourth century views still differed in regard to
the extent of the canon, or the number of the books which should
be acknowledged as divine and authoritative.

   The Jewish canon, or the Hebrew bible, was universally 
received, while the Apocrypha added to the Greek version
of the Septuagint were only in a general way accounted as books
suitable for church reading, and thus as a middle class between
canonical and strictly apocryphal (pseudonymous) writings.
And justly; for those books, while they have great historical
value, and fill the gap between the Old Testament and the New,
all originated after the cessation of prophecy, and the cannot
be therefore regarded as inspired, nor are they ever cited
by Christ or the aposteles.""

""In the Western church the canon of both Testaments was closed
at the end of the fourth century through the authority of
Jerome (who wavered, however, between critical doubts and the
principle of tradition), and more especially of Augustine,
who firmly followed the Alexandrian canon of the Septuagint,
and the preponderant tradition in reference to the Catholic
Epistles and the Revelation; though he himself, in some
places, inclines to consider the Old Testament Apocrypha
as *deutero* canonical, bearing a subordinate authority.""

This history goes on to say that Augustine attended both the
Council of Hippo and of Carthage.

It is interesting to note, however, the following footnote to
the fourth session of the Council of Trent.  The footnote 
lists various Synods which endorsed lists of canonical 
books, but then says ""The Tridentine list or decree was the
first *infallible* and effectually promulgated declaration
on the Canon of the Holy Scriptures.""

Which leads one to think that the RC canon was not official
until Trent.  Thus my previous erroneous statement was
not entirely groundless.

It is also interesting to note that the Council of Trent
went on to uphold ""the old Latin Vulgate Edition"" of 
the Scriptures as authentic.  Which, I would suppose, 
today's Catholic scholars wish the Council had never said.
Also the council made no distinction between deutero-canonical
and canonical books--in contrast to (Eerdman's statement of) the
fourth century views.

Note:  the following article is submitted on behalf of someone (Frank 
daniels) who has difficulty posting to s.r.c, email replies to 
daniels@math.ufl.edu

	I am unable to post to the bitnet groups.
	Here is a capsule history of the Shepherding/Discipleship Movement in
the Churches of Christ (i.e. Crossroads/Boston):

	I could trace the Movement back as far as 1800, and indeed some of its
roots go back that far, but these were really ""influences"" on the Movement,
and not the actual movement, per se.
	I will start in c.1920.
	In that day, there were 'white' churches and 'colored' churches in
nearly every area (due to segregation).  Modern Pentecostalism was developing
as a predominantly 'colored' phenomenon.  Here, there was great fanaticism,
emphasis on emotional experiences, and belief in a personal guidance and
indwelling of the Holy Spirit.
	Many 'white' Protestant churches were growing into what became known
as conservative fundamentalism.  By the 1940s, the evangelical movement was
in full swing, and many groups were becoming part of it.
	When the civil rights movement grew stronger (in the 1950's and 
1960's),
many 'white' church groups began to be influenced by the 'black' churches and
by what was going on there.  This spread started in the most liberal of groups
and spread to the more conservative ones by the late '60's.  In 1969, even the
Catholic Church was displaying evidence of influence by the other 
groups...still
evident today.

	The Churches of Christ are (and were) a very conservative Protestant
group.  When the influence from outside began to reach the CofC in c.1965, it
was generally not appreciated.  Conservative groups are very strongly 
resistant
to change, and the new movement was VERY different from the CofC status quo.
	The magazines put out at that time by CofC folks tell the story as it
unfolds.  New ideas came into the CofC.  There was a big push to reach out to
college students, young adults, and teens.  Some called this the Campus 
Evangel-
ism Movement.  Emotions, generally not highly regarded in the CofC at large,
played a more important role in the new movement.  In some places, people 
began
to speak in tongues (as their Pentecostal predecessors did).
	This was met with extreme criticism from within the Churches of 
Christ.
In some places, people were fired from their jobs for speaking in tongues or 
for
advocating the ""Holy Spirit Movement"", another name for the new branch.  The
term ""Underground Church of Christ"" also came into use because these people 
had
to hide their differences (or they might be ostricised).
	There were several congregations, however, whose leaderships were
receptive to the new ideas (at least in part; the tongues-speaking never 
really
caught on).  One of these was the 14th Street Church of Christ in Gainesville,
FL.  Campus Ministry had already been regarded as important at 14th Street, 
and
the new ideas seemed to be very helpful tools for evangelism.  They also 
seemed
to put vitality into the church, which many felt had been lacking.
	In October of 1967, the 14th Street congregation hired Chuck Lucas to
be its Campus Minister.  By 1970, he would move to being the congregation's
(lead) Minister.  In the late 60's/early 70's, the congregation worked with 
many
other groups.  They held Bible discussions at Daytona Beach during Spring 
Break.
They organized talks in the fraternities on the University of Florida campus.
They also worked with UF sports people.
	In 1972, the congregation ordered a larger building to be constructed.
When it was finished, the group moved and changed its name (now no longer
appropriate).  It became the Crossroads Church of Christ from then on, a name
that would become legendary.

	By this time, Crossroads was basically the only CofC whose programs
were fully aligned to the new movement.  While they didn't start it, they 
continued it and were responsible for where it wound up going.
	By 1975, none of the other Churches of Christ in the area felt that
they could cooperate with Crossroads, due to what they recognized as doctrinal
problems at Crossroads.
	Crossroads had begun to heavily emphasize, and later require 
attendance
at all church functions.  It was seen as a good thing for each member to have
at least one close relationship, a person with whom you would share all of
your problems, pray, and get help from.  The concept was called Prayer 
Partners,
which later became Discipleship Partners and also later became mandatory.  The
leadership was assigning prayer partners to people for a while.
	The book called ""The Master Plan of Evangelism"" was a strong influence
on Chuck Lucas.  He (and the group) believed that it was every person's duty
and life purpose to carry out the great commission.  Crossroads was growing
in number, and numbers became VERY important (some would say all-important).
	A person who ""was evangelistic"" was ""spiritual"".  Evangelism meant
inviting people to Crossroads events; if you did this a lot and some of them
converted, then you were ""spiritual"".  There were sermons about how if you
bought groceries, the cashier and bag boy ought to receive invitations to
services.  Everyone at your job ought to receive invitations.  Since these
people needed Jesus, you should be ""aggressive""--don't take 'no' for an
answer.
	If you did not evangelize enough, you came to be called ""lazy"" or
""unspiritual"".
	By the end of the decade, the Prayer Partner system was integrated 
into
a structure.  The Elders and Ministers were on top (like a big pyramid).  Then
the group leaders, Bible study leaders, and members.  Everyone who came in had
someone placed over them.
	It is at this time, 1978-1980, that the bad press about Crossroads
began to circulate.  The problem with rape on the University of Florida campus
was tremendous, but Crossroads was considered a bigger and more immediate
problem.  There were many complaints about the congregation and its ""pushy""
evangelistic tactics.  Crossroads was considering the other Churches of Christ
to be ""dead"" churches, which aggravated them; it was aggressively recruiting
out of the other church groups (denominations), which aggravated THEM.

	By this time, Crossroads had grown numerically to the point (1100)
where not only did they believe that they would soon need a new building, but
also they were sending out ""planting"" [create a new church] and 
""reconstructing""
[reorganize an existing church] teams to other cities.  By this time, the
Crossroads Movement was underway.
	A group was sent to the 30-member Lexington Church of Christ in 
Boston,
MA.  The team was headed up by Kip McKean, who had been converted out of a
fraternity by Crossroads (in Gainesville).  Kip held a still stronger view of
church authority, which he believed was heavily vested in the Evangelist(s),
and not so much in the Elders.  He had been fired in 1977 from the 
congregation
that he had been working at when the elders there found numerous things wrong
with his theology, including the practice of what came to be called one-over-
one
Christianity.  [Called this by critics]
	In the first year, half of the 30 people felt that they did not want 
to
be a part of the new congregation.  They left.  But others began coming into
the new Boston Church of Christ.
	Ah, but I'm ahead of myself.
	At Crossroads, the heavy-handed system had begun to take its toll on
the members.  Many have said that they felt that they were working hard, but
they were not achieving the results that were so important.  The numbers were
dropping.  From 1978, Crossroads membership declined steadily.  The leadership
began to tighten the reigns on the congregation, who was seen as being largely
""unproductive"" and ""unfruitful"".  The ""fruit"" passages in the NT were 
interpreted
as referring to new converts.  If you were not bearing fruit, said John 15, 
you
would be cast into the fire!  [Boston still teaches this.]
	If you love your neighbor, you'll save his soul (invite him to church
and convert him).  If you're not doing that, you don't love your neighbor.
And if you don't love, you're in danger of backsliding.  The logical arguments
continue in this vein.
	In 1985, Chuck Lucas was fired from his job as minister, due to 
recurring
sins in his life.  These struggles were never revealed to the congregation at
large, although many people outside the congregation had heard about them.  
For
by now, there was very little contact (on a friendship level) between most
Crossroads members and those outside.  [If you have contact, your focus should
be on converting them.  Bring them to a Bible Study.]
	Chuck's replacement was Joe Woods, who was fully supportive of the
Boston system.  As Boston grew in number, they began to offer 'training' 
sessions
for other ministers.  Joe went to Boston to be trained and returned to Cross-
roads ready to emphasize the ""total commitment"" to the church that Boston and
Kip McKean were now emphasizing.  Eventually, in Fall of 1987, the Elders at 
Crossroads (now 2 in number--Dick Whitehead and Bill Hogle) made a decision.
Boston was demanding that all of the other churches in the movement come under
the direction of the church in Boston.  The Elders refused, citing their 
belief
that each church should be autonomous (something true in all non-Boston 
Churches
of Christ).  Perhaps there was also some degree of offense done here, since
Crossroads was no longer the 'example' to the rest of the Movement.  The group
now numbered about 800, while Boston was now larger (in membership).
	The Churches of Christ generally teach that baptism is a necessary
element of salvation.  At Crossroads, they taught what was called 'Lordship'
baptism:  you had to understand the commitment involved before you could be
baptized.  You had to 'count the cost'.  At Boston, they took this a step
further.  If at some time you became ""unproductive"", then your spirituality
was suspect.  People would begin to ask you if you REALLY understood what you
were getting into.  Anyone who said 'no' had their baptism deemed invalid:  
they
hadn't counted the cost properly.  They still had to be baptized.  Others 
called
this ""rebaptism"", and Crossroads didn't approve of this practice.
	When Crossroads announced that it would not follow Boston, many of its
members left Crossroads and went to Movement-related ministries, which were
now called Discipling Ministries.  You were either discipling (evangelizing) 
or
you were ""dead"".  They also used the nickname ""Movement of God"" for a while.
	By Summer of 1988, Crossroads was withdrawn from the Movement and now
stood alone.  They had few to no allies in the mainstream Churches of Christ,
and now none in the Movement.

	Boston, however, continued to chart its course in the direction that
they had been following.  They sent ""reconstruction teams"" to many cities, 
which
usually meant that they split the church there.  They stopped acknowledging 
other
churches of Christ as Christians and began to call themselves the ""remnant"".
The ""remnant"" of the Jews in the OT are those who are saved by God.  It was
felt that the ""remnant"" today represents all the Christians.  Sometimes they
would simply call their Movement ""the church"".
	They usually took the name of the city for their name, implying to the
other Churches of Christ that Boston did not recognize their existence.  Many
campuses have now formally forbidden Boston ministries from recruiting there
due to the number of complaints.  In some cases, it has been documented that
Boston ministries have lied to University officials in order to continue to 
have
access to the campus.  Any resistance that they experience is termed ""perse-
cution"", which all true Christians are expected to experience.  Are you really
a Christian if you're not being persecuted?
	The numbers at Boston peaked at c.3000 in 1989.  Since then, they have
fought to remain steady.  I have heard a tape of Kip McKean shouting at the
leaders for failing to fulfill the Great Commission (their life's purpose) as
God commanded them.  Their Christianity is highly centered on commands and
obedience.

	Crossroads once was called a cult.  Boston is now recognized by the
Cult Awareness Network and other national and international groups as a cult,
under a formal definition, because of the techniques which they employ.  The
term ""cult"" is usually differentiated from ""sect"" by the practice of those
techniques.  The techniques which they employ are recognized by many as being
techniques of destructive pursuasion, also used by other Shepherding
Discipleship groups.  [Robert Jay Lifton, Margaret Thaler Singer, and many
others have written about the topic.]  These techniques include guilt 
motivation,
emotional manipulation, loaded language, the aura of sacred science (a sort
of mystic element seen in everyday events), and others.

	I have no particular axe to grind against the Movement.  I have numer-
ous friends who are still part of the Movement.  I have never had a 'falling
out' with anyone in the Movement.  I disagree with many things which they 
teach.
I recognize the psychological damage done by being involved in such a system.
I hold no loyalty to the mainstream Churches of Christ and do not defend their
mistakes either.
	I want to point out, though, that unlike in many other systems which
are in other ways similar, the Leadership of the Boston Movement are as much
victims of the system as the members.  We do not have a leader who enjoys
manipulating his people.  The leaders believe what they teach, and they feel
accountable for the activites (and spiritual welfare) of the members.  When
members do not evangelize to their expectations, for example, the leaders feel
personally responsible as well.  The leaders are not out for money or power.
They want to evangelize the world in their lifetime.

	I have said too much, but there is much more to say.  There are many
examples I could give and quotes from other sources (including Boston 
bulletins)
that I could include.  But this is too long already.  You may post this if
you so desire.

(on a side note, that ""under God"" wasn't in there until recently -- i
believe my father, who is in his sixties, remembers saying the pledge
of allegiance without that in there.  i don't know the history behind

emotional blackmail -- ouch.  thank goodness (i'll be neutral in my

so atheism doesn't have to be taught, but christianity does.  i guess

The kind of interpretation I see as ""incredibly perverse"" is that applied
to the story of Sodom as if it were a blanket equation of homosexual
behavior and rape.  Since Christians citing the Bible in such a context
should be presumed to have at least READ the story, it amounts to slander
-- a charge that homosexuality == rape -- to use that against us.

The moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of _porneia_
in this.  I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of
activity that could be named by ""fornication"" or ""theft"" or ""coveting"" or
""reviling"" or ""drunkenness"" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may
or may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very
fact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at
all ""clear"" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest
in MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions,
with all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated
Christian discussion of ALL these areas.

Homosexual behavior is no different.  I (and the other gay Christians I
know) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and
child molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly
""harmless"" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual --
that would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter
you cite [may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter that
you want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?]

	""'I am free to do anything,' you say.  Yes, but not everything
	is for my good.  No doubt I am free to do anything, but I for one
	will not let anything make free with me.""  [1 Cor. 6:12]

Which is a restatement that we must have no other ""god"" before God.  A
commandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break.  Some
people are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior.
It is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it's a secondary
argument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such
behavior as to equate it with the rape of God's messengers.

I won't deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially.
Fundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your
assumption that you know what _porneia_ means.  There are plenty of
laws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of
which Christians ignore completely.  They never even BOTHER to examine
them.  They just *assume* that they know which ones are ""moral"" and
which ones are ""ritual.""  Well, I have news for you.  Any anthropology
course should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories
in an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep).
And I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus
from the ""ritual law"" which NO Christian I know feels applies to us.

I'm dead serious here.  When people start going on (as they do in this
matter) about how ""repulsive"" and ""unnatural"" our acts are -- and what
do they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of
arbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating
insects.  On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you
say that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part
of the ritual law?

For those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can
be ""law"" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)
it is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to
determine why you ""pick"" one and ignore another.  I frankly think the
whole effort misguided.  Reread Paul: ""No doubt I am free to do anything.""
But Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this,
the Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor.  If you cannot go
through Leviticus and decide each ""command"" there on that basis, then
your own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy.  In this
context, it is remarkably offensive to say:

>I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the
>verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.

Well, la-ti-da.  So what?  This is almost as slimey an argument as the
one that homosexuality == rape.  I know of no one who argues seriously
(though one can always find jokers) in ""defense"" of bestiality.  It is
absolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do*
raise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human
adult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant
than the laws of kashrut.  If you cannot address the actual issues, you
are being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the
world.  If *you* want to address bestiality, that is YOUR business, not
mine.  And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in
our culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing
us as human beings.  You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means
you can think of to do so.

Jesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length,
the central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to
love one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ-
ians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get
in return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues.

Christians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every
corner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same
old verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never
even read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with
the vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can
manage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great
emotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even
taking the trouble to find out what it is.

Such behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ.
WHY, for God's precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to
condemn people you don't know and won't even take the trouble to LISTEN
to BEFORE you start your condemnations?  Is that loving your neighbor?
God forbid!  Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or
condemn others?  Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in
insisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you are
SO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do.

Why, for God's sake?

For long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from
evil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and
rejected.  Some of us despaired and took to courses that probably *do*
show a sinful shunning of God's light.  Blessed are those whose spirits
have been crushed by the self-righteous; they shall be justified.

However, we have seen the Truth, and the Truth is the light of humanity;
and we now know that it is not WE who fear the light, but our enemies who
fear the light of our witness and will do everything they can to shadow
it with the darkness of false witness against us.

If you want parallels the best source is probably the book _Temple
and Cosmos_ by Hugh Nibley.  It is not light reading however.

As to why these early practices ""only parallel"" and do not exactly
duplicate the modern LDS ceremony, there are a couple of reasons:

1.  Quite likely we do not have the exact original from ancient
times.  This stuff was not commonly known but bits and pieces
undoubtedly spread.  (Much as bits and pieces of the modern ceremony
get known.)  What we have in the 40 day literature, the Egyptian
ceremonies, and certain Native American ceremonies is almost
certainly not exactly what Jesus taught.

2.  Certain aspects of the ceremony are normally modified to fit the
situation, much as the modern ceremony has been modified to fit the
audio-visual tools now available.

The words I have underlined are at the heart of the problem. A ""quick
look"" doesn't do justice to the depth of the book of Jeremiah. Having
studied the Jeremiah/Ezekial period solidly for over a year at one
stage of my life, I have to say that there is a great deal of underlying
theological meaning in the judgement prophesies. Let me make one point.
The clash between Jeremiah and the ""false prophets"" was primarily in
the theological realm. The ""false prophets"" understood their relatioship
to God to be based on the covenant that the Lord made with David. It is
possible to trace within the pages of the Old Testament who this covenant,
which was initially conditional on the continued obedience of David's
descendants, came to be viewed as an unconditional promise on the part
of the Lord to keep a descendant of David's upon the throne and to never
allow Jerusalem to subjegated by any foreign power. Jeremiah was not a
Judahite prophet. He was from Anathoth, across the border in what had formerly
been Israelite territory. When he came to prophesy, he came from the
theological background of the covenant the Lord had made with Israel
through Moses. The northern Kingdom had rejected the Davidic covenant
after the death of Solomon. His theology clashed with the theology of the
local prophets. It was out of a very deep understanding of the Mosaic
covenant and an actute awareness of international events that Jeremiah
spoke his prophesies. The ""judgement prophesies"" were deeply loaded with
theological meaning.

In my opinion, both the Portland earthquake prophesy and the David Wilkerson
""New York will burn"" prophesy are froth and bubble compared to the majestic
theological depths of the Jeremiah prophesies.

I have quite a problem with the idea that Mary never committed a sin.
Was Mary fully human?  If it is possible for God to miraculously make 
a person free of original sin, and free of committing sin their whole
life, then what is the purpose of the Incarnation of Jesus?  Why can't
God just repeat the miracle done for Mary to make all the rest of us
sinless, without the need for repentance and salvation and all that?

I don't particularly object to the idea of the assumption, or the
perpetual virginity (both of which I regard as Catholic dogma about which
I will agree to disagree with my Catholic brothers and sisters in
Christ), and I even believe in the virgin birth of Jesus, but this
concept of Mary's sinlessness seems to me to be at odds with the
rest of Christian doctrine as I understand it.

David Hammerslag asked:

	How do you (Mormons) reconcile the idea of eternal marriage
	with Christ's statement that in the resurrection people will
	neither marry nor be given in marriage (Luke, chapt. 20)?

Several explanations for this seeming contradiction have been proposed,
but most LDS scholars whose opinions I have studied take more or less
one of the following three positions:

(1) Jesus was talking to a group of people (Sadducees) who were trying
    to trip Him up with what they felt was a silly hypothetical situa-
    tion that ridiculed the concept of a resurrection (something they
    didn't believe in).  These people -- and those associated with them
    (""Now there were with us seven brethren"", Matt. 22:25) -- would not
    be receptive to such higher blessings as eternal marriage.  Hence,
    the people in the story would likely not be married in the eterni-
    ties; but that doesn't mean other, more faithful people could not
    have this blessing.

(2) Jesus was making a distinction between the state or condition of
    =being= married, and the process of =becoming= married.  The latter
    activity (marrying and giving in marriage) will not take place in
    the eternities, because all eternal marriages will be taken care of
    before then.

(3) The account as we have it (in all three of the synoptic Gospels) is
    missing something that would make its real meaning clearer.  Note
    that we (LDS) do not believe in Biblical inerrancy, so we do not in
    general feel obliged to reconcile each and every Bible text with
    modern revelation through Joseph Smith and other latter-day proph-
    ets.  Nor are we particularly upset that the account in question
    was not significantly revised in the ""Joseph Smith Translation"" or
    ""Inspired Version"" of the Bible, since we do not believe this work
    was completed or that failure to revise a passage in the JST con-
    stitutes divine approval of that passage as it stands in the KJV.

This is curious. I read in _EH_...

I'm afraid that I cannot find this portrayal in _EH_. 
I don't see anywhere in 3:32:7-8 where Eusebius mentions that certain 
gnostics had the wrong gnosis.

The closest is when Eusebius summarizes Hegesippus' statements,

in dark retreats...""

""Favorably interpreted?"" Just in looking at two of the four 
references that you gave (I have the _EH_ handy, Irenaeus and the 
_Clemetine Recognitions_ I will have to look for) I see no room for 
such 'interpretations.'

And any such 'interpretation' still falls short of an equivalence to 
the Temple Ceremonies. 

The links for Jay's using _EH_ for support are: ""imparting the gift 
of knowledge"" = ""imparted secret information"" = ""being given secret 
signs and tokens to gain entrance to heaven.""  But there is not
enough equivalence between the the ideas for us to be able to call 
this ""favorable interpretation.""  It appears to be closer to 
""fabrication.""

Well, since my wife is (in your gentle term) a ""bastard"", I can
probably speak with a bit of authority on this. Any ""stigma""
associated with children conceived and/or born out of wedlock rests
solely upon the parents--they've committed a sexual transgression for
which they should repent. The child itself has no a priori limitations
on him or her; indeed, the concept of blaming the child for the
parents' sins is one most Mormons would find appalling; note that LDS
theology rejects original sin, as the term is usually defined, and the
subsequent need for infant baptism (cf. Moroni 8 in the Book of
Mormon).  Indeed, LDS doctrine goes one step further and in some cases
holds parents responsible for their children's sins if they have
failed to bring them up properly (cf. D&C 68:25-28; note that this
passage applies it only to members of the LDS Church).

Also note that there is no ""big genealogical book in Salt Lake City"".
The LDS Church has a massive storage facility in the nearby mountains
containing (on microfilm) vital statistic records (birth, christening,
baptism, marriage, death) gathered from all over the entire world. I
may be misremembering, but I believe they have records for some 2
billion people in that vault. At the same time, the LDS Church is
building up an on-line genealogical database. In neither case is there
some kind of ""worthiness screening"" as to whether someone can be
entered in. The only potential issue is that of establishing who the
parents were, and that would apply only in the case of the database.

My sentiments exactly... which is why I'm unsubbing from this group.
This is the 3rd 'christian' discussion list I have ever belonged to
and once again I'm being chased away by the strife, anger, discontent,
lies, et al .

theological discussions or thousands of lines of post-incarnation
trappings of some church.

   When an alleged private revelation attracts sufficient attention,
   the Church may investigate it.  If the investigation indicates a

   it will be approved.  That means that it can be preached in the
   Church.  However, it is still true that no one is required to
   believe that it came from God.  A Catholic is free to deny the
   authenticity of even the most well attested and strongly approved
   private revelations, such as those at Fatima and Lourdes.  (I
   suspect that few if any Catholics do reject Fatima and Lourdes, but
   if any do their rejection of them does not mean they are not
   orthodox Catholics in good standing.)

It may be a bit much to say that a Catholic is free to deny what
happened at Fatima.  That's a bit strong, it is sort of like saying
that a Catholic is free to deny that Hong Kong exists.  What a
Catholic *is* free to do is to deny the truth of Fatima, without being
called a heretic.  You can be labeled other things for such an
offense, but not a heretic.

Theologians make a basic distinction as far as the degree of assent
one must give to events like Fatima and Lourdes.  Things revealed by
God through Jesus Christ or His Apostles must be given the assent due
to a revelation of God: total and unswerving.  Fatima and Lourdes
demand our assent as much as any other well-attested event in human
history.  Perhaps a bit more, given the approval of the Church.

""Approval"" of an apparition by the Church principally means that
whatever happened was in harmony with the Catholic Faith.

I personally think of private revelations as our Lord's way of telling
us what to do at particular periods in history.  He gave us all the
doctrines, etc., 2000 years ago, but we can always use some help in
knowing how exactly to apply what He gave us.

Catholic devotion to the Sacred Heart was a result of a series of
apparitions to St. Margaret Mary Alacoque, for example.  The problem
at the time was extreme moral rigorism that was turning our Lord into
someone without a heart.

The Fatima apparitions were a warning of an impending crisis in the
Church (we are living it), and what to do to save the most souls
possible in such a situation.

It's my understanding that Romans 9:13 ""As it is written, Jacob have I

rather to their offspring, the tribe of Jacob and the tribe of Esau

See Obadiah, for example.  In fact, if you scan through the OT, you

Subject: Ten Commandments or Ten Discourses?
Lines: 135

In the course of discussing the Sabbath with some folks, 
I came across something that was completely new to me, 
and I thought I'd offer it for comment.

To keep this as brief as possible, let me state my 
observation as a declarative statement, and then whoever 
wants to can comment on it.  Basically, what I think 
I've observed is that the phrase ""the Ten Commandments"", 
as used by Moses, is not a reference to Ex. 20:1-17, but 
rather a reference to ten distinct discourses from Ex. 
20:1 through Ex. 31:18.  That is, the phrase ""the Ten 
Commandments"" should more accurately be translated ""the 
Ten Discourses"", of which the passage we call the ""Ten 
Commandments"" is really only the first.

I'm not completely convinced that the above is true, but 
for purposes of discussion, let me argue it as though I 
was sure.

Arguments supporting the above idea:

1)  There aren't really ten commandments in Ex. 20:1-17.  
In order to get 10 commandments, you have to get two of 
them out of verses 3-6, and the verses themselves do not 
support such a division because they are all about not 
worshipping other gods.  That is, verse 3 commands to 
have no other gods, and verse 5 commands to not worship 
the idols mentioned in verse 4.  You can't violate 
verses 5-6 without violating verse 3, indicating that 
the whole passage is one command, and leaving us with 
only Nine ""Commandments"".  I could go on at length about 
this, but for now I'll just stop with this summary.

2)  There ARE ten speeches between Ex 20:1 (the beginning
of the traditional ""Ten Commandments"") and Ex 31:18 
(where God actually gives Moses the two tablets with the 
Ten Commandments/Discourses written on them).  I break 
these ten down as follows: 20:1-17; 20:22-26; 21:1-23:33; 
25:1-30:10; 30:11-16; 30:17-21; 30:22-33; 30:34-38; 
31:1-11; and 31:12-18.  In most cases, each of these 
passages begins with some variation of the phrase, ""And 
the LORD spoke to Moses, saying...""  The exception is 
Ex. 21:1, which begins ""Now these are the ordinances 
which you are to set before them...""

3)  The word translated ""commandments"" in the phrase 
""the Ten Commandments"" isn't really the word for 
""commandment"", its the word for a speech, or an 
utterance.  It's a word often used for longer discourses 
rather than individual statements; for instance, when 
combined with the word 'yom' (day), this word is 
translated ""Chronicles"" in such phrases as ""now the rest 
of the acts of so-and-so, are they not written in the 
Chronicles of x?...""  The word for ""commandment"" is 
freely used throughout the books of Moses, and perhaps 
it is significant that when Moses spoke of the Ten X's, 
he appears to have avoided the word for commandment and 
chosen instead a word associated with discourses longer 
than just a single command.

4)  God tells Moses that He is going to give him the 
stone tablets ""with the law and the commandments"" (Ex 
24:12), yet He does not give Moses the tablets until He 
has finished all ten discourses on Mount Sinai.  If the 
Ten Commandments were only Ex. 20:1-17, it is not 
immediately clear why God would wait several days and 
nine more discourses before giving these tablets to 
Moses.  On the other hand, if we have the Ten Discourses 
written on the tablets, then it makes perfect sense that 
God would not give Moses the tablets until He had 
finished delivering all Ten Discourses.

5)  When Moses did get the tablets, he found that both 
tablets were written on both sides (Ex. 32:15).  If 
these Ten ""Commandments"" were only the first 17 verses 
of Ex. 20, God would have had to have written in LARGE 
letters!  Not that He couldn't have, of course, but it 
does seem more likely to me that this is a reference to 
two tablets containing ten discourses written in normal-
sized letters.

6)  In II Cor. 3, Paul seems to specifically single out 
the ""commandments written on stone"" as being the 
""ministry of death"", ""that which is fading away,"" and 
""the ministry of condemnation.""  With the possible 
exception of the commandment about the Sabbath, it is 
difficult to see why Paul would refer to the commands in 
Ex. 20:1-17 as being temporary, ""fading away""-type 
commandments.  This is less of a problem if the stone 
tablets should happen to have included all of the 
commandments from Ex 20 through Ex 31.

Arguments against this idea:

The main argument against this idea, aside from the fact 
that it contradicts a long-standing tradition, is that 
in Dt 5:22, Moses says, after quoting the commands in 
Ex. 20:1-17, ""These words the LORD spoke...and He added 
no more.  And He wrote them on two tablets of stone and 
gave them to me.""  This appears to identify the words 
just quoted as being the only contents of the two stone 
tablets.

That was my first impression, anyway.  However, after 
some thought, I noted that a great deal hinges on how 
you understand the phrase ""These words.""  If Moses meant 
""These words *which I have just related to you* were 
spoken by God"" etc., then that would mean that only the 
traditional ""Ten Commandments"" were on the stone 
tablets.  If, however, Moses was making a parenthetical 
comment--""These words *which I AM NOW telling you* were 
spoken by God"" etc.--then that's quite different.

I did note that in the Dt 5 account, Moses tells of 
being given the stone tablets BEFORE telling of the 
people asking Moses to represent them before God, 
whereas in the Exodus account, the people asked this of 
Moses between the first and second discourses, several 
days BEFORE God gave Moses the stone tablets.  This 
reinforces the idea that Moses' remarks in Dt 5:22ff 
were intended as a parenthetical remark, rather than a 
strictly chronological account of when God wrote what, 
and at what point He stopped adding to what was on the 
tablets.

Summary:  all things considered, I find it somewhat more 
likely that the nine commands in Ex 20 are really only 
the first of what Moses regarded as the Ten Discourses 
of God.  I don't know if anybody has ever espoused this 
idea before; it's brand-new to me.  So, while I lean 
towards accepting it, I would be very interested in 
hearing any comments and criticisms anyone may care to 
offer.

That's the whole point, David.  As spirits separated from their bodies

marriage, just as they cannot be baptized, since there is no physical
body to be baptized.  We perform these ordinances as proxies for them,

Though you can certaily assert all this, I don't see why it necessarily
has to be the case. Why can't hate just stay as it is, and not beget more?
Who says we have to get disgusted and start hating the sinner. I admit
this happens, but I donlt think you can say it is always necessaily
so.

Why can we not hate with a perfect hatred?

Certainly we should love even our enemies. Amos 5:15 says to hate the evil
and love the good. This can't contradict Christ's teaching. I think we tie
up both hate and love with an emotional attitude, when it really should be
considered more objectively. Surely I don't fly into a rage at every sin
I see, but why can I not ""hate"" it?

If we take things this literally then we must also forbid women from
speaking in church. Paul while led by the holy spirit was human and could
err. I find it interesting that CHRIST never discussed the issue of
homosexuality, certainly it existed back then and if it was a serious
transgression CHRIST would have condemned it. 
I find it disturbing that the modern church spends its energy trying
to stamp out something that CHRIST didn't consider worth a single word
of condemnation. CHRIST repeatedly warns us against judgement. 
Don't we risk ""judgement in equal measure"" when we condemn people who 
GOD himself did not judge when he walked on the earth?

       If you are questioning whether or not ""hating sin"" is consistent with
   Christianity; I ask you to consider the following Scripture:

       Romans 12:9 ""Let Love be without hypocrisy.  Hate what is evil, cling
                    to what is good.""

       What is it that Paul, through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit is
   calling us to hate?  Would God call us to do something that would
   eventually lead to hating our fellow man; especially when he commands us to
   do the opposite, to love your fellow man?

   >Consider some sin. Now lets apply our ""hate the sin..."" philosophy and see
   >what happens. If we truly hate the sin, then the more we see it, the
   >stronger our hatred of it will become. Eventually this hate becomes so
   >strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to
   >hate the sinner.

       That has not been my experience.  I've not found myself hating anybody
   as a result of hating the sin that may be in their life.  As a sinner
   myself, I find myself having more compassion for the person.  Jesus too,
   since the Bible teaches that he was tempted in every way that we are, is
   able to have compassion on us when we our tempted and fall.  Jesus is our
   very example of HOW to hate the sin but love the sinner.  In the account of
   the woman caught in adultery (John 8), Jesus had compassion on the woman;
   BUT he also called her to leave her life of sin.  This is what it means to
   love sinners but hate their sin; it means loving them unconditionally,
   while at the same time calling them to leave their sin.

   >In addition, our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and do things
   >which are taken personally by the sinner (who often does not even believe
   >what they are doing is a sin).

       The blame for this can not always be laid at the feet of the
   Christian.  I have seen and been guilty of taking offense by someone merely
   pointing out my sin and calling me to repent of it.  It was not unloving
   for the Christian to call me out of sin; in fact, I believe it was the most
   loving thing that that person could have done.  He loved me enough to want
   to spare me the consequence of remaining in my sin.

   >After enough of this, the sinner begins to hate us (they certainly don't
   >love us for our constant criticism of their behavior). Hate builds up and
   >drives people away from God...this certainly cannot be a good way to build
   >love.

       Again, I don't think that you can lay the blame for this at the feet of
   the Christian.  If we have loved them as Jesus loved sinners (exemplified
   in John 8) and the sinner hates us for it, then we have done the best we
   can.  We will have extended to them the most perfect expression of love and
   they will have rejected it.

       Now it we hate the sin but forget to love the sinner, then indeed, we
   will, ourselves, be in sin.

   >In the summary of the law, Christ commands us to love God and to love our
   >neighbors. He doesn't say anything about hate.

       I would like to encourage you to do a word study on HATE in the New
   Testament.  I really think that you will be surprised.

   >In fact, if anything, he commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves.

       Criticism is very different from calling a sinner to repent.

   Hope this helps,
   In Christ,

   - Scott

I too dislike the phrase ""Hate the sin, love the sinner"".  Maybe the
definite article is also part of the problem, since it seems to give
us license to fixate on our brother's peculiar pecadillo which we have
managed to escape by a common grace of heredity, economic situation, or
culture.  Our outrage at evil is too often just a cheap shot.

That said, I don't think Scott has adequately explored the flip side
of this coin, namely the love of righteousness.  In the Beatitudes,
Jesus blessed those who hungered and thirsted for righteousness.  In
the New Testament, it is never enough just to behave well, one should
always actively desire and work for the cause of good.  In that sense,
it should be impossible to remain dispassionate about evil and its
victims, even when these are its accomplices as well.

Maybe ""mourn sin, love sinners"" catches the idea slightly better than
""hate"", but only slightly, since grief usually implies a passive
powerless position.  A balanced Christian response needs grief, love,
and carefully measured, constructive anger.  Jesus has all three.  The
European pietists during WWII whose response to Nazi atrocities was
devoid of anger do not fare well as role models, however much love or
grief they exemplified.

My sister is an actress in New York and a Christian.  A few years
back, Jack, her long-time professional friend and benefactor, died of
AIDS, impoverished by medical bills, estranged from his family, and
abandoned by most of his surviving friends.  Only my sister and
brother-in-law were there with him at the very end.  In her grief over
Jack's death, my sister found quite a few targets for anger: callous
bureaucracies, the rigid self-protective moralism of Jack's family,
the inertia in Christians' response to AIDS, and, yes, even Jack's own
lapse in morality that eventually cost him his life.  Jack himself
shared that last anger.  Brought up with strong Christian values, he
was contrite over his brief dalliance with promiscuous sex long before
his AIDS appeared.  (I imply no moral judgement here about Jack's
innate sexual orientation, n.b.)

Maybe the hardest job is making our anger constructive.

The biblical arguments against homosexuality are weak at best, yet
Christ is quite clear about our obligations to the poor. How as 
Christians can we demand celibacy from homosexuals when we walk
by homeless people and ignore the pleas for help? 
Christ is quite clear on our obligations to the poor.

I can see that some of the above verses do not clearly address the issues, 
however, a couple of them seem as though they do not require ""incredibly 
perverse interpretations"" in order to be seen as condemning homosexuality.

""... Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolators, nor adulterers, 
nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, 
nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom  of God.  And such were 
some of you...""  I Cor. 6:9-11.

Would someone care to comment on the fact that the above seems to say
fornicators will not inherit the kingdom of God?  How does this apply
to homosexuals?  I understand ""fornication"" to be sex outside of
marriage.  Is this an accurate definition?  Is there any such thing as
same-sex marriage in the Bible?  My understanding has always been that
the New Testament blesses sexual intercourse only between a husband
and his wife.  I am, however, willing to listen to Scriptural evidence
to the contrary.

""You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an
abomination.  Also you shall not have intercourse with any animal to
be defiled with it, nor shall any woman stand before an animal to mate
with it; it is a perversion.""  Lev. 18:22-23.

I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the
verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.  I know
of no New Testament passages that clearly condemn, or even mention,
intercourse with animals.  Do those who argue for the legitimacy of
homosexual intercourse believe that the Bible condemns bestiality as a
perversion, and if so, why?  That is, what verses would you cite to
prove that bestiality was perverted and sinful?  Could the verses you
cite be refuted by interpreting them differently?  Can one be a
Christian zoophile?

By the way, I myself am subject to sexual desires that I did not
choose to have and that many people would regard as perverted and
sinful, so please understand that I am not asking these questions out
of an antipathy towards my fellow ""people of alternative
orientations"".  I do believe, however, that one should read the Bible
with an attitude of ""what is the Bible trying to say"" and not ""what do
I WANT the Bible to say.""  I choose not to give in to my ""perverted""
sexual desires because I believe the Bible tries to tell me, whether I
like it or not, that such things are sin.  It is frustrating at times,
and I have had days where it really got me down, but I don't blame God
for this, I blame the sin itself.

- Mark

[There's some ambiguity about the meaning of the words in the passage
you quote.  Both liberal and conservative sources seem to agree that
""homosexual"" is not the general term for homosexuals, but is likely to
have a meaning like homosexual prostitute.  That doesn't meant that I
think all the Biblical evidence vanishes, but the nature of the
evidence is such that you can't just quote one verse and solve things.

I think your argument from fornication is circular.  Why is
homosexuality wrong?  Because it's fornication.  Why is it
fornication?  Because they're not married.  Why aren't they married?
Because the church refuses to do a marriage ceremony.  Why does the
church refuse to do a marriage ceremony?  Because homosexuality is
wrong.  In order to break the circle there's got to be some other
reason to think homosexuality is wrong.

About scripture being against homosexuality:
------------------------------------------
When we  are
less homophobic we will see that what we know as gay and lesbian  people,
engaging in loving, voluntary erotic relations with each other, aren't  even
mentioned. [in the Bible, tk]

This frightens me (not in the homophobic sense, but intellectually),
especially because it was written by someone from a homosexual church.

So, if my interpretation is different than theirs, I am homophobic!  This
can't be right. Disagreement in interpretation of the Bible and/or rejection
of homosexual acts is not tantamount of homophobia.

I intend to endeavor to make the argument that homosexuality is an

Anyone who wants to join in on the fun in taking the other side,
i.e. that they can make the claim that homosexuality is not immoral,
or that, collaterally, it is a morally valid practice, is free to do
so.  I think there are a lot of people who don't believe one can have
a rational based morality without having a religion attached to it.

This should be fun to try and figure this out, and I want to try and

There is no question of similarity in Jesus indication about John.
The passage in Matthew is very direct.  Where Luke (1:17) reports
the angel Gabriel prophesying that John will go before Christ ""in the 
power and spirit of Elias"", In Matthew 11: 14, Jesus himself says of John,
   
   ""And if you care to accept it, he himself is Elijah, who
    was to come"".

It is interesting that Jesus prepended the words, ""If you care to accept
it"", as if to say that the implications of this truth, namely of rein-
carnation, I will not force on you, but for those who can accept it, here it
is.  A Jewish poster to other newsgroups on Jewish esotericism and other
topics has outlined the esoteric, cabbalistic Jewish teaching of of
reincarnation and Karma, a teaching that is little known among Jews
today, but which is apparently widespread enough in Israel that Hannah
Hurnard (""Hinds Feet on High Places"") was told about it by a Rabbi
she was trying to convert back in the 1940s as a missionary in Palestine.
Thus there may well have been a small number of Jews who knew about this,
whereas the large number of people did not.  The statement of Jesus about 
John, the greatest human personality in the New Testament, is guarded
but nevertheless quite direct.  Again, the subject of reincarnation, one
way or another, is not a subject of the New Testament, nor is the fate in general
of the human being between death and the last judgement.  But there are 
occasional indications that point to it.

As for the ""popular belief"" that Elijah would come again, it was more than 
a popular belief, as Jesus confirms it in more than one place, and he never 
corrected those who were expecting Elijah --  for example, those who thought 
that Jesus himself be he.

Paul's statement only asserts that that particular choice was not
a matter of karmic fulfillment of the past, just as the fate of the
man born blind (John 9) was not.  There is no question here of the
simplistic idea of karma as a machine that is the sole determiner
of one's destiny.  Even the eastern traditions, or many of them,
do not say that, as one knowledgeable poster pointed out.

And if in fact that Paul did not know about or believe in reincarnation
does not say anything one way or another about it.  Even John the Baptist,
who Jesus says emphatically is Elijah (Matt 11:14), does not appear to 
have been aware of it, at least at the point at which he was asked. But 
it is interesting that his threefold denial -- to the question whether 
he is the Christ, the Prophet (i.e. Isaiah), or Elijah, is emphatic in 
the first case and very weak in the third.

I would like to add once again that, while it is important to discuss the
different passages that may point directly to the teaching of repeated
earth lives, one way or another, what I really see as important in our
time is that the subject be revisited in terms of the larger view of
Christianity and Christian doctrine.  For the most part, those who do
accept it either reject the central ideas of Christianity or, if they
are Christians, hold their conviction as a kind of separate treasure.
I believe that Christianity has important new understanding to bring
to bear on it, and vice versa, much that is central to Christianity
takes on entirely new dimensions of meaning in light of repeated earth
lives. It has a direct bearing on many of the issues frequently discussed 
in this newsgroup in particular.

I have said openly that I have developed my views of repeated earth lives
largely from the work of Rudolf Steiner.  Not that I hold him as an
authority, but the whole picture of Christianity becomes clearer in light
of these ideas.  Steiner indicated that the old consciousness of reincar-
nation necessarily had to fade away that it could be renewed in later
times, after a time of development of the Christ idea through the first
two millenia after Christ's deed on Golgotha.  In our own time, it becomes 
important that, having received the basic gospel of salvation, our 
understanding of life and of the human being can now grow to embrace the 
significance of this idea.  For the discussions in this newsgroup, I 
have tried to focus on that which can be related as directly as possible 
to scripture and to fundamental Christian teaching and tradition.

Maybe you should dig a little further Charles.  Hislop's scholarship was
accepted by the Bristish Oriental Institute which, at the time, was the premere
Institute for Oriental studies.  As I've stated over and over,  I've checked
out about 25% of his references (most are now out of print or in private
libraries) and the likes of Wilkerson and Layard hold their own merit.  THey
too came to the same conclusions and if you will trouble yourself, you will
find that their knowledge of the mysteries have yet to be surpassed.  Both were
highly honored by the British Oriental Museum.  Wilkerson is known as one of
the leading archeologist in the history of Egyptiology and Layard is still
being refered two after 200 yrs of archeology in the Mesopotamian regions.  He
was recently refered to in a TIME article on Babylonian archeology.  

Phony scholarship is when you review their references and find that they have
misquoted or misrepresented the conclusions.  Hislop did not.  His conclusions
do not tickle the ears, that much is self evident.  But to assert that his
conclusions are ""spurious"" is without merit.  He gave references to all his
conclusions and as I have stated, for the last 25 years I have used his
conclusions in debates at RC seminaries and brotherhoods, not to mention the
individual priests and bishops that I have talked to one on one.  No counter to
Hislops scholarship was made.  The only rebuttals were against his conclusions
because they do totally undermined the claims of the RCC. He was showing that
the intitution of the RCC was based on the mysteries (which others have shown
even to this day in various articles and topics).  THe tongues movement in
Corinth was a direct result of the mysteries entering into the church.  If it
was so in Corinth, why could they not have an influence in Rome, the city of
seven hills?

Also, you do not have to listen to his conclusions, you can draw your own
conclusions by looking at the customs, artifacts, the cerimonial dress, the
docrine of purgatory, etc from the vantage of the mysteries.  You don't even
have to be a believer to see the parallels.  Just one example.  THe mitre. 
Where did it come from?  Why is it shaped the way it is?  What are the two
tails that hang down the back represent?  Was this an ancient  head dress from
an earlier culture and why was it in Rome at the time of the beginnings of the
church of the State of Rome?  Does it have pagan history behind it, and if so,
why did the RCC chose regardless?

Any lay person of middle eastern religion can answer these questions.  Even the
scriptures themselves refer to it.  All Hislop did was collect the information
from all the various sources and put them in one binding.  There is no lack of
scholorship in that.

Please tell me why you discredit this man by your accusation, yet present no
evidence supporting it.

Note that ""scientific evidence"" in this area does not prove any conclusions.
There has been evidence to suggest that a certain part of homosexual's
brains are different from heterosexuals- but that proves very little.

Also notice that the apostles did not have with them the ""scientific
evidence"" linking certain genes with alcoholism, or stealing with certain
genetic problems.  Even if they did have scientific evidence, I doubt it
would have stopped them from communicating the teaching from the Holy 
Spirit that these things are sinful.

This reminds me of a conversation with a professor of mine.  He said 
something very true.  Christianity teaches that we should not give in
to our every inclination.  Most people do give in to their leanings.
In Christianity, we have the concept of struggling with the flesh,
and bringing it into submission.  One person may have a problem with
his temper, and having a murderous heart, another may have a problem
with homosexuality, another may be inclined to greed.  But God offers
us the opportunity to be more than conquerers.

In Revelation 2-3, we see that in the first century church, there was one
congregation in each major city.  So there was one unified church.  Now in
each city, there were people of different cultures.  Naturally, they
formed something of a stew, with different members having different
heritages.  Nevertheless, they were ONE body.  They met together,
sometimes as smaller groups in their homes and sometimes in bigger groups
in places such as the temple courts.

Now in a particular city, then and now, you will find that there is a
common language associated with that region.  For instance, in Rome, Latin
was spoken.  In the United States today, English is spoken.  So it would
make sense that congregations in different cities would speak the common
language and not necessarily Latin.

Naturally, you would expect the lead evangelist to preach in the common
language.  In the first century church, there were probably many people
in the congregation who could speak a given tongue to translate the
message for people of foreign ethnic groups.  Today, however, you don't
see people speaking in tongues to translate sermons, even in so-called
Pentacostal churches.  We do have a modern day equivalent though --
bi-lingual speakers.  Now in the unified church of which I am a member -
sometimes called the International Churches of Christ, when we all meet
together on Sundays, there are headphones on people who don't speak
English from which they hear an ongoing translation of the sermon in their
native tongue.  Neat idea, huh?

Now, we meet in different size groups in a random sort of way on Sundays,
so sometimes there will be a meeting of only Haitians or of Spanish-
speaking people, for example, who will hear an evangelist preach in their
native language.  In addition, we meet in small groups a couple of times
during the week for Bible discussion groups and Devotionals.  So someone
who speaks a different language will almost always be with people who also
speak his language (assuming the congregation is large enough) for those
meetings.

As for the people who speak the common language, they can keep in touch
with their culture, if they want, but they will also have equally deep
friendships among their church relationships with people of many various
nationalities.  

>Has the purpose of the church been thwarted by this action?

The action of letting Catholics worship in a native language instead of
Latin?  Indeed not!  See my second paragraph in response to the second
clipping of your article.

However, if you mean the action of forming denominations based on a
culture, then the purpose of the church has been indeed thwarted.

I'll assume the second possiblility when answering your next clipping.

>Rather I believe it has been enhanced, for Paul exhorts us to become as

You have met some needs of people, certainly, by helping them to be proud
of their cultural heritages when most denominations didn't.  Yet you have
largely isolated yourselves from having quality ""Christian"" friendships
outside your nationality (and your denomination).

We shall certainly give people a place to feel comfortable with their
heritage.  However, we will do this in a way that does not destroy church
unity, but rather encourages friendships among all disciples.

>This is the approach of some of the groups that you cite. 

It sounds like these groups have wonderful intentions, but they are going
about things in the wrong way.  And names like the African Methodist
Episcopal Church still make me cringe, although not as much as before.

I understand that there was more racism in the past that caused such
groups to be formed, but now we should try to unite.  I know that it's
hard for many people on this newsgroup to imagine there being only one
body of people on earth, but it is quite possible, and I am working to
make it happen.  However, what might be a smaller step towards unity,
would be taking the word ""African"" out of your denomination's name.  Then
perhaps someday a long time off, you can also remove the ""Methodist
Episcopal"" part also, and simply be part of ""the Church"".

I'm afraid I see that question as very tendentious.  Try rephrasing it:

	What's more important to Christians?  Love of God or love
	of other human beings?

to which of course the only conceivable answer is that the one is like
the other.  I am *deeply* suspicious of any ""flavor"" of Christianity
which would elevate one clause of the Great Commandment to a ""priority""
over the other such as to claim a conflict.  True, we are told to let
the dead bury the dead, to ""hate"" family rather than let it keep us from
following Christ.  But the dichotomy here is not one between love of our
fellows and love of God, but of allowing *social* constructs to blind us
to the presense of God.  It is particularly satanic to twist love of God
in such a manner as to become an excuse to treat others as on a different
level than the one who is so caught up in ""love"" of God.

The trouble comes in the relation of human love and human sex.  Yes, it
has sometimes been the case that the Church has ""taught"" that all sex
was nasty, evil, sinful stuff.  But when man and wife leave their parental
homes to become helpmates, living in one flesh, it is the sex that is the
vehicle of becoming ""one flesh"" (if you doubt me, read St. Paul on what
is wrong with frequenting prostitutes :-)).  Less provocatively, what I
mean is just this: sexual bonding is a deeply founded aspect of our social
interaction, and in particular is the foundation of the institution of
marriage, so that unlike with many mammals, human males remain with and
foster the children they beget and support their children's mothers.
This is the schema behind Genesis 2:18-24 (and behind Jesus' citation of
that passage.)

	[ I observe, by the way, that not all human males in fact do as
	  I have just described; but another thing that characterizes
	  human societies is our raising of *non*begotten children, not
	  only orphans and adoptees and the like, but products of the
	  quite common infidelities of humans to their spouses. We are
	  in this not unique in the animal world, but the full extent of
	  social consequences and implications is most intricate for us. ]

Yes, of course it sometimes goes ""wrong"" -- like all else we do, it is
infected with sin, and you find married ""couples"" where there is no bond,
and people so deliriously addicted to the initial stages of sexual bond
formation (the ""infatuation"", ""falling in love"" phase) that they break
any forming bond in order to keep stepping over the threshold of the deep
unity God has prepared for us, and stepping back out again right away.
Satan may indeed *use* sex as a very handy tool to corrupt human love --
but in the Edenic creation, that is not its nature, and with God's grace
under the power of Christ to make all things new it need not be a problem
for Christians (though we must be vigilant, even in Christ, as the devil
is watchful, prowling around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour.)

So, returning to the original question, what is more important to STRAIGHT
Christians?  Sex, or Christianity?  Paul, clearly, tended to think that
sex was at best a distraction from Christianity (though to be charitable
to him, his context was in expectation of immediate parousia, so that the
hard TASKS of a married union -- the lifelong building and adaptation to
each other -- seemed somehow to undercut the ""proper"" preparation for an
immediate eschaton.  Since we *do not* know the hour of return, we should
act *both* with instant readiness for that *and* with a commitiment to our
mates that proposes a long lifetime together.  And telling people *not* to
bond in such a perspective strikes me as crippling us in the second clause
of the the commandment to love.  I would claim that only a very few saints
have the CAPACITY to deeply love (without sexual tinges or complication,
mind you) their fellow human beings unless they have had a deeply spiritual
life in married union growing together as one flesh -- and that means in
the type case, with a persistent and continued sexual relationship.  We
are human, and little good comes of trying to ""mortify the flesh"" to the
point of pretending to be otherwise, pretending NOT to be sexual beings.

>Christianity I would hope.  Would they be willing to forgo sex
>completely, in order to avoid being a stumbling block to others,

It depends entirely on context.  If that context is major hypocrisy
on the part of those who find us ""stumbling blocks"" I am much less of
a mind to efface myself so that they can pontificate about MY sins.

There are some people for whom a life of celibacy is a spritual gift,
and maybe even a victory against a to-them troubling sexual urge that
seems to them to lead only to sin.  Nothing I say should ever be read
as demeaning such a gift.  Nor the even rarer gift of love for all our
conspecifics, and indeed for all God's creation, that can develop to
the full *without* the tutoring of a spousal/helpmate marriage founded
in sex.  But there is a difference between spiritual gifts and penance;
telling people that they HAVE to have a particular gift (or else? what?)
is fraught with manipulation and disregard of the differences of our
spiritual endowments from God.  To one person is given the gift of
speaking in toungues, to another intepretation of toungues; to yet
another prophecy; and to still another teaching.  The notion that some
*particular* gift is required of *all* is one of the earliest heresies.

: this verse indicates that she was without sin.  Also, as was observed at
: the very top of this post, Mary had to be free from sin in order to be the
: mother of Jesus, who was definitely without sin.

If the mother of Jesus had to be without sin in order to give
birth to God, then why didn't Mary's mother have to be without
sin in order to give birth to the perfect vessel for Jesus?  For
that matter, why didn't Mary's grandmother have to be without sin
either?  Seems to me that with all the original sin flowing
through each person, the need for the last one (Mary) to have
none puts God in a box, where we say that He couldn't have
incarnated Himself through a normal human being.

My God is an all powerful God, Who can do whatever suits His
purpose.  This includes creating a solar system and planet earth
with the appearance of great age; providing a path through the
Red Sea for the children of Israel that does not depend on the
existence of a ridge of high ground and a wind blowing at the
right speed and direction; and the birth of Himself from a normal
sinful person without being tainted by her original sin.

I see far too much focus on the ""objects"" of religion and not
nearly enough on the personal relationship that is available to
all believers with the Author of our existence, without the
necessity of having this relationship channeled through conduits
to God in the form of Mary, Apostles and a Pope.

: Note that the idea of Mary being conceived without Original Sin, i.e. the
: Immaculate Conception, is distinct from the idea of Mary not having sinned
: during her lifetime, which is a separate doctrine and, I believe, also
: held by the Catholic Church.

If Mary was born without original sin, and didn't sin during her
lifetime, how is she any different from Jesus?  This means the
world has had two perfect humans:  one died to take away the sins
of the world;  the other gave birth to Him?  I would certainly
want to see some scriptural support for this before I would start
praying to anyone other than God.  Everything I have ever read
from the bible teaches me that Jesus was and is the only sinless
Lamb of God, not His mother, grandmother........

: Hope this is useful to you.

Very useful in helping me understand some of the RC beliefs.
Thank you.

The problem with this view is that the topic under discussion in this
passage *is* marriages that were performed on earth.  Jesus' words
seem to me to indicate that He regards His response as the answer to their
question about which earthly marriage would be valid after the resurrection.
This being the case, the most straightforward interpretation, in my
opinion, is that marriage does not exist in the next life because those
who are raised are of a different nature than what we are now.  Other-
wise, why would Jesus offer ""but are like the angels in heaven"" as a
contrast to the idea of the resurrected marrying and being given in
marriage?  We do not have angel-like natures now, but someday we shall,
and when we do, our earthly marriages will be irrelevant.  Or at least,
that's what I think Jesus is saying about the post-resurrection validity of 
marriages performed on earth.  Your mileage may vary. :)

I forgot exactly what her age was but I remember clearly
that she was born in a family of poverty and she did not
have any education, whatsoever, at the age of the apparitions.
She suffered from asthma at that age and she and her family were
living in an abandoned prison cell of some sort.

She had to ask the 'Lady' several times in her apparitions about 
what her name was since her confessor priest asked her to do so.  
For several instances, the priest did not get an answer since 
Bernadette did not receive any.  One time, after several apparitions
passed, The Lady finally said, ""I am the Immaculate Conception"".
So, Bernadette, was so happy and repeated these words over and
over in her mind so as not to forget it before she told the
priest who was asking.  So, when she told the priest, the
priest was shocked and asked Bernadette, ""Do you know what
you are talking about?"".  Bernadette did not know what exactly
it meant but she was just too happy to have the answer for
the priest.  The priest continued with, ""How did you remember
this if you do not know?"".  Bernadette answered honestly that
she had to repeat it over and over in her mind while on her
way to the priest...

The priest knew about the dogma being four years old then.
But Bernadette did not know and yet she had the answer which
the priest finally observed and took as proof of an authentic
personal revelation of Our Lady to Bernadette.

(Note: This Lady of Lourdes shrine has a spring of water which
our lady requested Bernadette to dig up herself with her
bare hands in front of pilgrims.  At the start little
water flowed but after several years there is more water 
flowing.)

Arguably, it is both. Since authority is a matter of both
communicator and recepiant we can say that, for example ""Jesus
is Lord"" whether the world at large accepts the authority or
not. Thus the Bible can be considered for its authoritative
content whether or not it is accepted (This issue is at the
heart of Pilate's pragmatic question ""What is truth?"" to Jesus
when our Lord was brought before Him. Jesus' reply was to appeal
to the authority of his Father)
You also might like to consider the claimed authority
represented by the statements ""thus says the Lord"" in the Bible,
which claim to put across the exact words of God.

You fall into the danger of relativism with your rejection of
inherant authority and claim that it lies only in the ""community
of faith"" - does something become truth because it is accepted?
The main thrust of my argument is that there is a Godward
direction as well as a manward (which is where the reference to
Rev 22 came in.)

If we narrowed it down to the predictive elements - which will
cut out some of the 39 accepted OT books as well - we
nonetheless have criteria for determining the validity of the
book: Jesus' standards were that ""Scripture cannot be broken"".
Can you name a single prophecy that fits the bill in the Apocrapha?
(ie definitely fulfilled AFTER it has been written)

Does it have a subjective 'ring of truth' about it - and does
other evidence that has come to light contradict or confirm the
authenticity? (archaeological, other textual evidence for
example)

What this is getting at is the relationship between text and
reader. It is to do with the quality of writing, which should
have the ability to fire the mind, affect our thought life and
cause us to act in a certain way - there is something of this
in Jesus' quote: ""Man does not live by bread alone, but by every
word that proceeds from the mouth of the Lord"". (Matt 4.4)

Does the Catholic Church give the same authority to the
Apocrapha as to the accepted 66 books? Certainly it is not as
widely used as the OT and NT.

Think about what I have said above. You may want to revise your
conclusion. In addition think about other 'sacred writings', eg
the Koran, the book of Mormon and how and why you would
categorise them using the above principles. One word of caution
- you may find some 'reflected glory' in some of these books: in
that the 'inspired quality' may be derived from the Bible.
Remember that Lucifer is quite capable of appearing as an angel
of light and quoting Scripture.

We've lost the point and the context here. I am not arguing that
the statement in Rev. can be applied indescriminately, just that
the whole acceptance/rejection idea does not just follow on from
man-made traditions - but there is I believe an act of God
involved in the selection and criteria of what is classified as
Scripture and comes under the definition of 2Tim 3.16.

Subject: Marian Apparitions #1
Organization: Ft. Lauderdale, FL
Lines: 56

The Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to Catherine Laboure, a nun of the
sisters of Charity on July 18, 1830 at Rue du Bac, Paris.

Sister Catherine was awakened late that night by a small boy, age 5
or 6, who was literally glowing with some sort of interior light. 
The child led her to the sanctuary of the chapel where he promised
the Virgin Mary was to be found awaiting her. Our Lady appeared to
her and instructed her for two hours or more on matters pertaining
to her life and to the future of France and the world.

On November 27 Our Lady appeared again to Catherine. She instructed
her to have a medal struck. She told her that those who wore this 
medal would enjoy special protection from the Mother of God and would
receive great graces. In less than a year there were three more
apparitions. In June of 1831 the medals were a reality. Many reports
were received by those who wore it. Within two years of its issuing
the medal was known as the ""Miraculous Medal"". Catherine died in 1876.
Her body to this day is remarkably preserved (incorrupt). She was
canonized on July 27, 1947. Her body lies in the chapel at the
motherhouse on the Rue du Bac where she had her first meeting with
Our Lady.

The apparition on November 27 1830 was of average height and clothed
in white with a veil that flowed over the head and fell to the floor.
Above the altar, a pyramid painted to represent God's all knowing
wisdom looked down on them. Our Lady's feet rested on a white globe
and there was also a green serpent with yellow spots that she was
stepping on. In her hands was a golden ball that represented the world.
Great streams of light issued from her hands and she also showed 
Catherine an image of two hearts, the Sacred Heart wrapped in
piercing thorns and her own heart punctured by a sword. The sword
represented her suffering with Jesus.

The apparitions announced the onset of the great battle and forewarned
that a dark era lay in the immediate future. It was the apparition 
leading up to the recent ones. Our Lady began to dispense secrets.
And with the globe she revealed herself in worldwide dispute
with the forces of the dark. She told Catherine ""The times are
evil. Misfortunes will fall upon France. The throne will be
overturned. The entire world will be overcome by evils of all
kinds.""

Refer to books on St. Catherine for more of Our Lady's messages.
A copy of the medal is also available in Catholic bookstores.

I will post other Marian events every few days or so including
the ones happening today which are still under investigation.
These postings serve only to introduce you to these events.
Please look more into them and understand the reason for 
the increasing number and urgency of these apparitions.

Yes, but no more than he is worth. :-).  Seriously: Jerome is merely
(and grandly) another Christian witness, to be taken for what he can
tell us.  He is one in the community of saints.  You seem to wish for
a greater polarization and dichotomy between Catholic and Protestant
thought than seems to me, from a historical perspective, to be valid.
To be sure, Rome rejects (some significant aspects of) Protestant
thought just as vehemently as Protestants reject (some significant
aspects of) Roman thought.  Other than some peoplw who apparently try
to embody the greatest extreme of this rejection, on either side, there
is not quite so vast a gulf fixed as casual observers seem to assume.

Ecumenical consultations between Rome and the Lutherans, as well as 
those between Rome and the Anglican communion (to which I belong) show
very nearly complete convergence on understanding the basic theological
issues -- the sticking points tend to be ecclesiology and church polity.
Thus, for example, as you go on to say:

Many of us do not regard a papal decretal as having any necessary (as
opposed to political) significance.  Sometimes it will, sometimes it
won't.  You misread me if you think that my communion, at least, ""throws
out"" the deuterocanonical books.  Nor do I think you should overstress
the sense in which the more Reformed may do so.

I seriously suggest you rethink what you are saying here.  It verges on,
and could be taken as, anti-Semitic in the worst sense.  The ""unbelieving""
Jews were, according to what I understand as a Christian, the chosen
people of God, and the recipients of His pre-Incarnational revelation.
I think they have some say in the matter.  The Javneh meeting should not
be over-interpreted.  A recent magisterial study titled _Mikra_ (I don't
have more citation information on hand, sorry) produced primarily from
the background of Christian (rather than specifically Jewish) scholarship
suggests strongly that the Javneh meeting mostly resolved a lingering
question, where in practice the canon had long been fixed on the basis
of the scrolls that were kept in the Temple, and thereby ""made the hands
unclean"" when used.  The list of ""sacred books"" that may be drawn up from
Josephus and other pre-Yavneh sources correspond (plus or minus one book,
if I rememeber the chapter correctly) to the current Jewish canon of Tanakh.

All of this is not to ""throw out"" the deuterocanonicals (what, by the way,
is YOUR position about the books the Greeks accept and Rome does not? :-))
-- just to observe that the issue is complex and simply binary judgment
does not do it justice.

I can see you have a revulsion for bestiality that far exceeds my distaste for 
homosexuality.  Certainly if I spoke about homosexuality the way you speak of 
bestiality, nobody would have any trouble labelling me a homophobe.  Let me ask 
this gently:  why are you so judgemental of other people's sexual preferences?  
What happened to ""No doubt I am free to do anything""?  I think you have a 
serious double standard here.  When you describe a comparison between 
homosexuality and bestiality as ""slimey"" and ""sleazy"", you are making an 
implicit judgement that bestiality is perverted, sinful, disgusting, 
unnatural--in short, all the things that society once thought about 
homosexuality.  Not all people share your view.  You claim not to know any 
sincere zoophiles, but this does not mean that they do not exist.  They even 
have their own newsgroup:  alt.sex.bestiality.  Are you going to accuse them 
all of being mere ""jokers""?

I notice you deleted the main point of my comment:  the fact that the only 
Biblical condemnations of bestiality occur in connection with the Levitical 
prohibitions against homosexuality.  While there are some New Testament 
passages that can arguably be taken as condemning homosexuality, there are none 
that condemn bestiality.  One of your main points seems to be that Christian 
homosexuality is acceptable due to the lack of any ""clear"" New Testament 
statements against it; if this is a valid argument, then should not Christian 
zoophilia be made that much more acceptable by the fact that the New Testament 
makes no reference, clear or unclear, to the subject at all?

I am quite serious here.  If I am going to accept homosexuality as Biblically 
acceptable on the basis of your arguments, then I am going to be fair and apply 
the same standards to everyone else's declared sexual preferences as well.  If 
the arguments you make for homosexuality can be applied to other sexual 
preferences as well, I'm going to apply them and see what comes up.  I'm not 
trying to ""torpedo a serious issue"" by using what you label ""a ridiculous 
joke"".  I posted a question about how we should interpret Biblical guidelines 
for Christian sexuality, and I don't think such a question is ""irrelevant"" in a 
group called ""soc.religion.christian"".  The Bible discusses homosexuality and 
bestiality together in the same context, and therefore I feel I have a good 
precedent for doing the same.

I don't know whether it makes any difference, but for the record, this is not a 
side issue for me.  I believe loving one another includes not encouraging 
people to defile themselves, therefore it is of high importance to determine 
whether God regards certain sexual acts as defiling.  I can read in the New 
Testament that ""God has joined together"" heterosexual couples, and that the 
marriage bed is undefiled.  I can read in the Old Testament that homosexual 
intercourse and bestiality defile a person whether or not that person is under 
the Law.  If gay Christians can validly put aside the Old Testament standards 
of defilement, then I want to know so that I can fairly apply it to all the 
sexual practices that defiled a person in the old days.  I don't think it's 
right to take just bits and pieces of the Law and try and apply them to 
Christians today, e.g. bestiality still defiles you but homosexuality doesn't.  
That was pretty much what you said earlier, right?  You used different 
examples, but I think you said essentially the same thing about it being wrong 
to apply only certain parts of the Law to Christians.

It was not my intent to stir up such an emotional reaction.  I personally don't 
get all that upset discussing alternatives to the monogamous heterosexual 
orientation; I'm afraid I naively assumed that others would have a similar 
attitude.  Please note that I have never intended to equate homosexuality with 
child abuse.  I have merely noted that, for all the lack of ""clear"" NT 
condemnation of homosexuality, there is an even greater lack of NT condemnation 
(or even mention) of bestiality, a practice which a number of people (e.g. on 
alt.sex.bestiality) consider to be their true sexual orientation.

This is an excellent question, and I pray that you will not treat it as a mere 
rhetorical question, but will genuinely seek to discover and understand the 
answer.  I recommend you begin with a little introspection into why you 
yourself have much the same attitude towards zoophilia.  Why do you find 
bestiality so repugnant that you regard it as slanderous to even mention in 
connection with other alternative sexual orientations?  Why do you not apply 
all the same verses about love and tolerance to zoophiles the way you apply 
them to homosexuals?

Is it because you automatically experience a subjective feeling of revulsion at 
the thought?  A lot of people have the same experience at the thought of 
homosexual intercourse.  Is it because you regard the practice as socially 
unacceptable?  A lot of people regard homosexuality as socially unacceptable.  
Do you feel that it violates the traditional Judeo-Christian standard of sexual 
morality?  Many people feel that homosexuality does.  Do you feel the Bible 
condemns it?  Many people think the Bible says more to condemn homosexuality 
than it does to condemn bestiality.  Why then do you think comparing bestiality 
with homosexuality is insulting to homosexuality?  If you can honestly answer 
this question, you will have come a long way towards understanding why many 
people feel the same way about homosexuality as you feel about bestiality.

Also please note that I am not in any sense condemning *people*.  I am merely 
pointing out that when I read the Bible I see certain sexual *practices* that 
the Bible appears to condemn, e.g. sex outside of marriage.  When I say I think 
adultery and pre-marital sex are sinful, do you take that as me failing to love 
my neighbor?  When you treat bestiality as something disgusting and 
unmentionable, are you disobeying ""repeated orders not to judge or condemn 
others""?  When you say other Christians are guilty of sinning by condemning you 
and judging you, are you by that accusation making yourself guilty of the same 
offense?  Or are you and I both simply taking note about *practices* the Bible 
brands as sinful, and leaving the judgement of the *people* up to God?

I'm not sure what you mean by the above two paragraphs.  If you mean that Jesus 
is the Truth, and that He accepts sinners, and does not reject them, then I 
agree.  If we were not sinners, then we would not *need* a Savior.  Our 
salvation in Christ, however, does not mean that sin is now irrelevant for us, 
and we can now do whatever we want.  Nor does Christ's grace mean that those 
who refer to sin as ""sin"" are being judgemental or intolerant.  I am speaking 
in general terms here, not specifically about homosexuality.  If the Bible 
calls something ""sin"", then it is not unreasonable for Christians to call it 
sin too.

As applied to Christian homosexuality, I think the only definitive authority on 
Christian sexuality is the Bible.  If you make a list of everything the Bible 
says on the subject of homosexual intercourse, I think you will find that every 
verse on the list is negative and condemning at worst, and ""unclear"" at best.  
The most pro-gay statement you could make about the list is that there is some 
dispute about the New Testament verses which many people interpret as 
condemning homosexual intercourse.  That is, from a gay perspective, the most 
positive thing you can say about the Bible's treatment of homosexuality is that 
some verses fail to clearly condemn it.  That's it.  Jesus declared all foods 
clean, the council at Jerusalem declared that Gentiles were not required to 
keep the ritual Law, but nobody ever reclassified homosexual intercourse from 
being an abomination deserving of death to being an accepted Christian 
practice.  You have verses describing homosexual intercourse as an abomination 
that defiles both Jews under the Law and Gentiles not under the Law, and you 
have some verses which are at best ""not clear"" but which some people believe 
*are* clear in their condemnation of homosexual behavior, and that's the sum 
total of what the Bible says about same-sex intercourse.

I can appreciate (from personal experience) your desire to have everything 
simple, cut-and-dried, black-and-white, what-I-want- is-ok, and 
those-who-oppose-me-are-wicked.  However, I do not think the Bible makes your 
case as definitively as you would like it to.  In fact, I don't believe it says 
anything positive about your case at all.  Yes, I know the verses about loving 
one another, and not judging one another, but that's not really the issue, is 
it?  You know and admit that there are still things that are sinful for 
Christians to do, since you say it is wrong for Christians to condemn you.  
Therefore, the issue is whether the Bible says homosexual intercourse is a sin.  
Even if you do challenge the clarity of the New Testament verses, you are still 
left with the fact that the only thing the Bible does say clearly about 
homosexual intercourse is that it is an abomination that defiles both those who 
are under the law and those who are not.

[Actually I don't think the reaction to the comparision with
bestiality is based on bestialophobia.  I think what he regards as
slimey is the rhetorical approach of connecting homosexuality and
bestiality.  Most people who accept homosexuality take a radical
approach to the Law.  They regard all of Lev as not binding on
Christians.  The argument is that there's no way in the text to
separate bestiality, homosexuality, and wearing mixed fabrics.  This
does not mean that such people have no limits on their conduct, nor
does it mean that they accept bestiality.  It simply means that their
sexual ethics does not come from the Law, and particularly not from
Lev.  --clh]

Curiously enough, this subject has occupied a good bit of my prayer life
recently.  God's experience of time is so completely different from our own,
since He is both within and without it.  Using words like ""foreknowledge""
and ""predestination"" are semantically incorrect when it comes to describing
God's perception of our action, because, for God, the beginning, living, and
ending of our lives are all the same.  Sort of.  For God, there is no ""before""
when He did not know, so he could not have ""foreknowledge"" of our lives or
a time when he could have ""predestined"" our actions.  In fact, since our
understanding of things is so tied to our linear experience of time, I
would say that it is impossible for us to understand completely how our
free will interacts with God's control of the universe.

It's always a two-way street.  God gave her the grace to avoid sin,
thus when she was visited by Gabriel, she gave her fiat, her total
acceptance of God's will.  This fiat summarizes why Catholics regard 
her as the highest of all humans, that God chose her and that she
accepted.  Knowing this in advance, we extrapolate that she was
neither stained by nor subject to original sin.

God did create us all miraculously free to choose or not choose to sin.
""Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof and the grace of God to
command it.""  This amount of grace was precisely determined by God
to be the amount required to do what God asked of her.  The grace
given to each of us is also enough, but we do not always choose
to accept it.  We also believe Jesus was fully human and never
sinned.  

God could have created a much better person than myself, one who
always chose the right thing, yet he created me instead, despite
my flaws.  He proves he loves me as I am, continually drawing me
towards perfection.  For whatever purpose he has for me, he has
confidence that I will accomplish it.  If I ask God to repeat his
miraculous creation of the mother of his son, where will that leave me?

This may sound argumentative, but do the pro-homosexual crowd give the
same support to church members that are involved in incestuous relationships?
If we do a little substitution above, we get:

""although by no means all episcopalians are sympathetic to incestuous
men and women, there certainly is a fairly larget percentage (in my
experience) who are.  I am good friends with an episcopalian minister
who is ordained and living in a monogamous incestual relationship.  This

Do the same standards apply?  If not, why not?  And while we're in the
ballpark, what about bestiality?  I can't recall offhand if there are
any direct statements in the Bible regarding sex with animals; does that
activity have more or less a sanction?

Please avoid responses such as ""you're taking this to extremes"".  I would
guess that a disproportionate percentage of the inerrant Bible community
views homosexual acts with distaste in the same manner that society at
large views incest.

[ Obviously you can replace homosexuality in the above statement by
anything from murder to sleeping late.  That doesn't mean that the
same people would accept those substitutions.  The question is whether
the relationships involved do in fact form an appropriate vehicle to
represent Christ's relationship to humanity.  This is at least
*partly* an empirical question.  

In some cases types of human relationship have been rejected because
over time they always seem to lead to trouble.  I think that's the
case with slavery.  One can argue that in theory, if you follow Paul's
guidelines, it's possible to have Christian slaveholders.  But in
practice, over a period of time, most people came to the conclusion
that nobody can really have that degree of control over another and
not abuse it.  

The message you were responding to was asking you to look at the
results from Christian communities that endorse homosexuality.  (Note:
Christian homosexuals, not people you see on the news advocating some
extremist agenda).  You may not want to base your decision completely
on that kind of observation, but I would argue that it's at least
relevant.  You can't answer the request by asking why you shouldn't
look at the Incest association, because in fact there is no such
association.  If there were, it might be reasonable for you to look at
it too.  Of course that doesn't mean that the results of all such
examinations would necessarily come out the same way.  Part of why
there aren't groups pushing all possible relaxed standards is that
some of them do produce obviously bad results.

  A weekly dialogue with a local pastor on the news of the day

                   -= THIS WEEK'S THOUGHTS =-

Last week the Supreme Court refused without comment to hear an
appeal by Rensselaer, IN, school officials desiring the
distribution of Bibles in their public schools (REL65, 5/21). A
lower court had banned the local Gideons, an international Bible-
distribution group, from passing out Bibles to fifth-graders. The
ACLU's Barry Lynn was quoted as saying that the court's action
protected the ""religious neutrality of our public schools."" He also
said that schools must serve students of ""all faiths and none.""
Schools were not to be a ""bazaar where rival religious groups
compete for converts,"" according to Lynn.

Several Gideons, men who are responsible for putting Bibles in
hospitals and hotels, are members of our church. They tell of
similar stories where they are only allowed to distribute Bibles on
sidewalks around the schools, but cannot go inside the schools.
They tell of mild harassment by parents who do not want their
children receiving a Bible from a stranger. They are willing to
continue their work at a distance, but find the school's position
somewhat disheartening.

I understand rationally and logically the court's position. And, I
can see the sense of fairness for all groups. But, on the other
hand, when does ""neutrality"" become ""nihilism?"" When does plurality
turn into no position at all?

I see a couple of ironies here. One is that we can pass out condoms
but not Bibles in our schools. Think on that one for a moment.

The other is that while we are seeking ""religious neutrality"" in
our schools, countries like Russia--who, by the way, practiced
""religious neutrality"" for the past seventy years--are making the 
Bible part of their public school curriculum. When I was in St.
Petersburg in March, the church we worked with had trained over 100
public school teachers to teach the Bible, and the government had
requested hundreds more! I recently heard a medical doctor who is
president of the Gideon chapter in Moscow tell how they are eagerly
invited to the University of Moscow to distribute Bibles to the
students and are given class time to explain its contents. I
remember seeing a photograph of this doctor holding a Bible and
speaking to the university students standing under a statue of
Lenin. Now, that's ironic!

I admit two things: 1) We are a pluralistic society, and all faiths
have equal footing. This is what our country was founded on. 2) To
allow every group on school grounds could create a bazaar-like
atmosphere. Each city must work to be inclusive of all religions
and provide a hearing for them. 3)--I know I said two--The vitality
of religious faith is not dependent upon whether or not the public
arena acknowledges it as valid.

However--and you knew this was coming--I believe, disallowing the
distribution of the Bible by law-abiding, caring adults in our
schools only signals once again our culture's movement away from a
singular base from which we as individuals and as a nation can make
moral and ethical decisions.

John,

I agree that the ""home"" ain't what it used to be, and some homes
are NOT the place to learn value-based sexuality. I still believe
that this is where the church can come into play. I know, those
families you speak of may not come to a church to seek information,
but the help does not need to be in a church building...I believe
that the youth from the families you mentioned will probably
disregard the value-free information at school, too.

It might be interesting for folk to know that the Church of Scotland
(also a Presbyterian church)  managed to ""agree to disagree"" over
women's ordination for 25 years.  The reasoning was that congregations
are free to call whoever they wish, and that Ministers and Sessions
choose elders.  If a congregation did not wish to have a woman, they
were not obliged to, and if a Session did not wish to, they could not
be forced to.  (Note that the who issue of freedom to call on the part
of the Congregation is VERY important here - this year is the 150th
Annivarsary of the Disruption, where the church split on that very
issue, they didn't get back together for almost 80 years).

A couple of years ago on the 25 anniversary of the allowing of womens
ordination the position was changed - so that, in theory, all
ministers and elders must recognise that women can be ordained.  In
theory, a minister who refused to ordain a woman to his Session, or
refused to work with a woman minister in Presbytery, could be
disciplined.  In practice this has not happened, and I believe it is
unlikely to happen.  My personal view is that the new legislation was
a mistake, and that the permissive (but not prescriptive) legislation
worked very well.  

We are going to start going round the homosexual debate at next years
assembly.  At this years, a motion was put to ban the blessing of
same-sex couples (after an Edinburgh minister did so).  Our Panel on
Doctrine is currently looking at marriage, and will report next year -
the matter will be considered and debated then.

Hope this is interesting

Yes, but Jesus also made a very general and doctrinal statement
in the same conversation:

""Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit.""
(John 3:6)

Clearly infants are not born of the spirit.  Thus, without baptism
they are unspiritual.  They are not born with the image of God, but in
Adam's fallen image (cf. Gen 5:3).  They have no righteousness of
their own, just as adults have no righteousness of their own.  There
is only the imputed righteousness of Christ, which believers receive
through faith.

Alan> 3.  We can ask ourselves why the Lord would even introduce the

Your point is a little obscure here, but I think you are saying
that Christ used the ""innocence"" of newborn babes as a metaphor
for spiritual re-birth.  But this is not what he did.
If you look at the text, he did not speak
of spiritual re-birth but of spiritual birth.  We are
born of the Spirit once, not twice or several times.
We are also born of the flesh once.  The Lord makes it
clear that these are separate and different events.
It is true that other Scriptures refer to spiritual
birth as re-birth because it is a second birth
(for example, Titus 3:5).  But it is not a second
*spiritual* birth.

The only thing the two births have in common is the concept of birth,
which is used as a symbol of `new life' -- not of innocence.  When an
infant is born (or conceived) a new life is begun--but it is neither
innocent nor righteous.  Similarly when that same individual is
baptized, or perhaps when they believe prior to baptism, they begin a
new life in Christ (Romans 6:3, Colossians 2:12, Titus 3:5, Ephesians
2:5).  Then the believer has God's assurance of the forgiveness of
their sins, and of Christ's imputed righteousness.

It's not scriptural, but comes from the patristic age, I think:
something about ""amare errantem, interficere errorem"", which sounds
more like ""love the errant, slay the error"".  No doubt someone else 
will know in particular who minted the phrase.  If I had to guess, I'd

The so-called Athanasian Creed has never been a recognized standard of faith

No smiley on the part about atheism, I see. Do you realize that your

hard for me to defend against if this is the claim you are making, as you
have only included the last two sentences of my post and mentioned the
first. Please address the substance of my post rather than rejecting it
out of hand. 
But, because of the sometimes ambiguous nature of English, I may be
misinterpreting your wording here. Please clarify: did you or did you not
mean to call my statements about atheism ""nonsense""? If so, care to back
up that claim?

>>	Do I sound ""broken"" to you?

OK, then. Start up the amatuer psycology again. How am I ""broken""?

>Is it politically correct for Christians to be the only besieged group
>permitted the luxury of arrogance?   

*YAWN* Excuse me, I don't recall any portion of my post in which I called
Christians arrogant quote me, if I did. I do remember calling Christianity
""silly"" and then following that up with information that I was nine years
old when I thought that. I also said that I find faith to be intellectually
dishonest and I would like to see some sort of proof of your god's
existence. I define ""faith"" as ""belief in the absense of any proof"", BTW.

Also, I subscribe to a.a as I mentioned and we see fundies of all types
there, so in answer to your question: ""no.""

Finally, I'd hardly call Christianity ""beseiged"" in this country. I seldom
see Christians ridiculed for merely practising their religion or wearing
crosses or having Christian bumper stickers. I don't know for sure, of
course, I only say I haven't seen it happening. What I have seen happening
is my homosexual and/or friends being beat up, or preached at by people
who claim to be Christ's followers. I know that this sort of thing isn't
practiced by the majority of Christians, but it is a very vocal minority
who are doing it and I don't see comperable victimization of Christians. 

>Now I have a question for Bob.  Why in the world would any self-respecting

The implication being that I am not self-respecting, of course. I'm not a
student of psychology, BTW, but I am a student of Creative Writing and
Linguistics, so literary analysis _is_ my forte. Also, if the implications
I see are improper, please let me know.
I'm here because I'm not sequestered in my own little atheist cubbyhole as
you seem to think atheists should be. Did it occur to you that I _don't_
think I know everything and that maybe someone will say something that
will change my life? Have you read my other posts here or did you see
""atheist"" and decide it was time to poke at someone who doesn't deserve
your respect?
Aw, geez. I'm sorry, I probably am getting my back up a little too high,
here. It's just that the ""nonsense"" thing really annoys me. I figure you
should see my first reactions, though, since they are my true reactions to
your question.
Now, the smoothed feather version:
I seek all sorts of knowledge. That's why I came to my university. Yes, I
am looking at your religion (well, sorta, I have no idea what *kind* of
Christian you are) from the outside, and hopefully with an objective view.
I've been trying to ask reasoned questions here, because I genuinely don't
know the answers to them, but when I saw the question directed at atheists
I figured I would answer. After all, you can speculate about atheist
motives here all you want (hence the ""amatuer"" psychology crack), but
without an atheist, you can't be sure of even one atheist's motive.       
I'm hoping people really
want to know and I was trying to show that I actually checked out several
religions and I actually read all the pamphlets people have to offer and I
actually think about these things. Instead, I'm still faced with the
implication that atheism is some kind of aberration and that only ""broken""
people are atheist.
	Try it from the flip side: I posit that atheism is the natural
state and only broken people are theists. I offer as proof that so many
people witness from horrible lives which picked up as soon as they 
discovered their religion, that religion is regional (if people didn't
follow the religion of their areas, there would be a more homogenous
mix), so many terrorists claim theistic motives, and that theists tend
to be so pushy and angry when challenged on alt.atheism. Why are religions
so successful? Because there is so much suffering in the world, which 
""breaks"" people.
It's an uncomfortable situation whichever way you look at it, which is another
reason I'm here, to try to see the flip side of my thinking (and also as 
a watchdog for logical fallacies :).

The implication here being that atheists can't possibly know anything
about Christianity. Probably jumping at shadows again, but I think my

atheists are ""broken"", hostile people. This post confirms that someone

Well, he got me there. I am a strong atheist, because I feel that lack of
evidence, especially about something like an omnipotent being, implies
lack of existence. However, I haven't met the strong atheist yet who said
that nothing could ever persuade him. Call me a ""seeker"" if you like, I
don't. 
_Weak_ atheism is being ignore here, though. Some atheists simply say ""I
don't believe in any god"" rather than my position: ""I believe that no
god(s) exist."" For the weak atheist, the is no atheism to disbelieve,
because they don't actively believe in atheism. (If you think this is
confusing, try figuring out the difference between Protestants and
Methodists from an atheist point of view :).
This is another fallacy many theists seem to have, that everyone believes in
something (followed up by ""everyone has faith in something""). Guess what?
My atheism ends the moment I'm shown a proof of some god's existence. Is
that really too much to ask?


>Well, I don't even waste my time trying.

supposition that you will fail to convince him? (amatuer psycology on) Is

> I tell him that he'll just have to take my word for it.
And I told you that I find faith to be intellectually dishonest. Note that
I can only speak for myself. If you find faith to be honest, show me how.
I have been unable to reconcile it so far. Maybe that's how I'm ""broken""?
I tell you that I have invisible fairies living in my garden and that
you should just take my word for it. If you accept that, you are of a
fundamentally different mind than I and I really would like to know how you
think. All I ask for is proof of the assertion ""God exists"". Logical or
physical proofs only, please. Then we'll discuss the nature of ""God"".

The above article is a good short summary of traditional Christian
teaching concerning the death of Mary.  
Also very good is ""Re: Question about the Virgin Mary"" by Micheal D.
Walker.  He tells the story very well.
I would like to add that in the Eastern Orthodox Church we celebrate ""The
Dormition (or falling asleep) of the Theotokos (the mother of God)"".  The
Icon for this day shows Mary lying on a bed surrounded by the Apostles
who are weeping.  Christ, in his resurrected glory, is there holding what
seems to be a small child.  This is, in fact, Mary's soul already with
Christ in Heaven.  The Assumption of Mary is one more confirmation for us
as Christians that Christ did indeed conquer death.  It forshadows the
general resurrection on the last day.  The disciples were not surprised
to find Mary's body missing from the grave.  She was the Mother of the
Savior.  She was the first of all Christians.  She gave birth to the Word
of God.  If it were not for her we would not be saved.  This is why we
pray in the Orthodox Church, ""Through the prayers of the Theotokos,
Savior save us.""

I would say only to the extent that the Roman Catholic Church
neither approves nor disapproves of capital punishment, as
confirmed in the recent catechism, though there are many RCs
who were rather surprised and upset that capital punishment was
not explicitly condemned.

For myself, as a Catholic, I see my own opposition to capital
punishment as much the same as my opposition to abortion - a
reverence for life. Here in the UK, the anti-abortion case is
often let down by the explicit link which those on the
political left make with anti-abortionists and
pro-executionists. There is a tendency to condemn people who
hold both views as hypocrites. I feel that if there were many
more anti-abortionists who were also vocal in their opposition
to capital punishment on a pro-life line, it would end this
kneejerk association of anti-abortion as a right-wing thing,
and get many to think seriously about the issue (there are
plenty who are pro-abortion equally for a kneejerk left-wing
reason).

I do not think your biblical quote can automatically be taken
as support for capital punishment. I take it that as a Roman
Catholic you are opposed to abortion, and would still onsider
it wrong, and something to be objected to even if legalised by
""authority"".

   Jung may have said that, but he was in no way speaking for the
Catholic Church.  The dogma of the Assumption in no way means Mary is
considered to be God or part of ""the Godhead.""  Therefore it implies no
such thing about the feminine in general.

   Also Jung's statement makes it sound as though the dogma was
announced ""out of the blue.""  This also is incorrect, as dogma is only
the formulation of what has always been part of Tradition.  This dogma
has always been believed, but was not formally defined until the
Assumption was declared as an _ex cathedra_ statement.

Not exactly correct, but nice try.  The Catholic doctrine of infallibility
refers to freedom from error in teaching of the universal Church in 
matters of faith or MORALS.  It is this teaching which is taken as

I see your point, but I cannot more strongly disagree.

To repent means to turn around.  We, as a nation, have behaved incredibly
arrogantly toward God condoning, encouraging, and even forcing folks to
participate in activity directly opposed to the written Word of God.  We
have arrogantly set our nation far above the God who created it and allowed
us the luxury of living in this land.  We have set a bad example for other
nations.  We've slaughtered unborn children by the millions.  We have
stricken the name of God from the classroom.  We've cheated God out of the
honor due Him at every turn, and we owe God an apology every bit as public
as our sins have been.

When Jesus said ""Judge not that ye be not judged"", he was not addressing
those like John the Baptist who had repented and were calling others to
repent.  He was addressing those who remained in sin while heaping down
condemnation on others for their sins.  His message to us all was to remove
the log from our own eye before removing the speck from our brother's.  But
He also said to rebuke and to reprove.  Don't forget that this is a command
too.

Our problem today is that we tend to judge and condemn as though we were
rebuking and we tend to neglect bringing folks back to the Lord with the
excuse that we don't want to judge anyone.

In truth, what we need to do is to judge less and call others to repent more
and to be able to distinguish between the two in our own motives.  Call sin
what it is and do so openly.  Let it's charge fall correctly where it should.
But instead of running someone into hell over it, pull them out of their
hellward path and onto the heavenward path.

While this is essentially a discussion of reincarnation in the context of
Christianity Gerry Palo has made some comparisons to Asian religious
beliefs on this topic which have simplified the Asian idea of karma
to the point of misrepresentation.

There are significant differences in the idea of karma among Hindus,
Jains, Buddhists (and even among the various Buddhist traditions.)

To refer to karma as a system of reward for past deeds is totally
incorrect in the Buddhist and Jain traditions.  Karma is considered to
be a moral process in which intentions (either good or evil) shape
a person's predilections for future intention and action and
produce a person who is more prone to good than evil, or the opposite --
""reward"" has nothing to do with it.  Both Jainism and Buddhism are atheistic
so there is no deity to dispense rewards or punishments.  Karma is usually
described in terms of seeds and reaping the fruit thereof.  In fact ""As you
sow, so shall you reap"" is found in the Pali Canon as I recall, the metaphor
of natural growth is explicit.

Hinduism, or some sects in that tradition, are I believe much more
deterministic and involve concepts closer to reward and punishment being
theistically inclined.

In point of fact, the Theravadin Buddhist tradition of Southeast Asia
considers karma as only one of five influences in human life, and in
fact from their point of view they would be unable to explain the mechanics
of karma without the element of free will.

Also in Eastern religions there is a difference between reincarnation and
rebirth, which is essentially absent in Western considerations.

Isn't Origen usually cited as the most prestigious proponent of reincarnation
among Christian thinkers?  What were his views, and how did he relate them
to the Christian scriptures?

Subject: Baptism requires Faith
Organization: Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Lines: 144

It troubles me that there have been so many posts recently trying to support
the doctrine of Original Sin.  This is primarily a Catholic doctrine, with no
other purpose than to defend the idea of infant baptism.  Even among, its
supporters, however, people will stop short of saying that unbaptised infants
will go to hell.

It's very easy for just about anyone to come up with a partial list of
scripture to support any sort of wrong doctrine.  However, if we have the
heart to persevere in our beliefs to make sure that they are biblically
based, then we can come to an understanding of the truth.  Let's now take a
more complete look at scripture.

Colossians 2:11-12 ""In him you were also circumcised, in the putting off of
the sinful nature, not with a circumcision done by Christ, having been
buried with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the
power of God, who raised him from the dead.""

In baptism, we are raised to a new life in Christ (Romans 6:4) through a
personal faith in the power of God.  Our parent's faith cannot do this.  Do
infants have faith?  Let's look at what the Bible has to say about it.

Romans 10:16-17 ""But not all the Israelites accepted the good news.  For
Isaiah says, 'Lord, who has believed our message?'  Consequently, faith
comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word
of Christ.""

So then we receive God's gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the
gospel.  Faith is a possible response to hearing God's word preached.  Kids
are not yet spiritually, intellectually, or emotionally mature enough to
respond to God's word.  Hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot
be raised in baptism to a new life.

Ezekiel 18:20 ""The soul who sins will die.  The son will not share the
guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son.  The
righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the
wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him.""

If you read all of Ezekiel 18, you will see that God doesn't hold us guilty
for anyone else's sins.  So we can have no original guilt from Adam.

Ezekiel 18:31-32 ""Rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committted,
and get a new heart and a new spirit.  Why will you die, O house of Israel?
For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign Lord.
Repent and live!""

The way to please God is to repent and get a new heart and spirit.  Kids
cannot do this.  Acts 2:38-39 says that when we repent and are baptized, we
will then receive a new spirit, the Holy Spirit.  Then we shall live.

Now then that we have a little more background as to why original sin is
not Biblical, let's look at some of the scriptures used to support it.

Romans 5:12 ""Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and
death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all
sinned--""

Sin and death entered the world when the first man sinned.  Death came to
each man because each man sinned.  Note that it's good to read through all
of Romans 5:12-21.  Some of the verses are easier to misunderstand than
others, but if we read them in context we will see that they are all
saying basically the same thing.  Let's look at one such.

Romans 5:19 ""For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many
were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many
will be made righteous.""

Through the disobedience of each individual, each was made a sinner.  In
the same way, through the obedience of Jesus, each will be made righteous.
We must remember when reading through this passage that death came to each
man only because each man sinned, not because of guilt from Adam.
Otherwise the Bible would contradict itself.  I encourage you to read
through this whole passage on your own, looking at it from this point of
view to see if it doesn't all fit together.

Psalm 51:5 ""Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother
conceived me.""

This whole Psalm is a wonderful example of how we should humble ourselves
before God in repentance for sinning.  David himself was a man after God's
own heart and wrote the Psalm after committing adultry with Bathsheba and
murdering her husband.  All that David is saying here is that he can't
remember a time when he wasn't sinful.  He is humbling himself before God
by confessing his sinfulness.  His saying that he was sinful at birth is
a hyperbole.  The Bible, being inspired by God, isn't limited to a literal
interpetation, but also uses figures of speech as did Jesus (John 16:25).
For another example of hyperbole, see Luke 14:26.

Now then, even though people see that baptism requires faith and that
original sin is not Biblical, they will still argue that infant baptism is
necessary because children sin by being selfish - not sharing toys with
other children, by being mean - hitting others and fighting, etc.

Certainly we have observed children doing wrong things, but my gut feeling
is always that they don't know any better.  Let's look to see if the Bible
agrees with my gut feelings.

Isaiah 7:14-15 ""Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign:  The
virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him
Immanuel.  He will eat curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the
wrong and choose the right.""

Now just about any church leader will tell you that this is a prophecy
about Jesus.  If they don't, then point them to Matthew 1:23 and find a new
leader.  Jesus certainly couldn't have had less knowledge than normal human
babies.  Yet this passage says that he had to mature to a certain extent
before he would know the difference between right and wrong.  We see that
he did grow and become wiser in Luke 2:40 and 2:52.  The implication is
that Jesus did wrong things as a child before he knew to choose right over
wrong.  Since we know that Jesus was perfect -- without sin, we have rather
conclusive proof that babies cannot sin because they don't know to choose
the right instead of the wrong.

Jesus himself was baptized, albeit with John's baptism, not as an infant,
but as a thirty-year-old man (Luke 3:21-23) and started his ministry as
soon as he was baptized (Luke 3:23).  Immediately afterwards, he was
tempted by the devil (Luke 4:1-13; Matthew 4:1-11; Mark 1:12-13).

Thank you for your attention.

[I think you're overly optimistic about the authoritative quality of
your response.  First, original sin is not a Catholic-only doctrine.
It was held by Luther and Calvin as well, and is still present in one
form or another in the Lutheran and Reformed traditions.  Second,
saying that it has no other purpose than defending infant baptism is
an ad hominem argument, which has considerable evidence against it.
The original Baptist theology included original sin, and some Baptists
still hold it.  And there are certainly groups that baptize infants
without believing in original sin.  Among Protestants, the sacraments
tend to be a bit more symbolic than among Catholics.  Protestants who
baptize infants see baptism as a sign of God's acceptance of us,
rather than our acceptance of God.  In traditional Protestant
theology, God's grace precedes our response, and is applicable to
children.  There are a number of passages one can cite to indicate
that God accepts even children.  --clh]

This thread si starting to get really silly. Such nonsense do not
belong in s.r.c and it really hurts me to read some of the posts on
this issue.

We chose to believe whetever we want, but we are not allowed to define
our own Christianity. we see in parts. If you see something that I do
not see, or vice versa, it does not give me the right to play jokes on
your belief!

There is no wonder that your ""miracle"" does not work. You designet it
yourself, and even if you were able to collect a group of people like
the one you describe, I see no reason why your ""miracle"" should really
happen. God is the one who does miracles, not humans!

After all we are all on the same way, or at least, we are all headed
for the same goal, following different paths. Remember that we are
going to spend eternity together. If I can not stand your view here on
earth, how can I possibly stand spending eternity together with you?

Tongues is a question of belief. Not wether you believe in Jesus, but
if you believe that He is able to give you this gift. Just as any
other of the gifts mentioned in the Bible. But there is no evidence in
the Bible that people who do not accept these gifts are in any way
better than others.

Maybe some of the people who have received spiritual gifts are more
interested in glorifying themselves than glorifying God, I don't know.
But if this is the case, it still does not suggest that the gifts are
faked.

In the Bible you will find that Jesus did not always do miracles. He
said that ""I do nothing, except what my father tells me."" Perhaps it
woulkd be for the best of all if we where all able to live by that
example!

In Him,

I was simply observing that as a non-Jew, I am not in that community

I wish the Dialogue_with_Trypho were a real transcript of a real

Meaning what? Do you affirm the principle (that the D.c's can be

If affirmed (as is implied in your statement) how does one determine 
that doctrine X is false? Do you affirm every teaching in _Ecclesiastes_?

If so, it may be a test that cannot be applied. The Orthodox
faithfully believe that Psalm 151 is canonical. How can my
faith say 'Not!' ? All I hear here is the *a priori* I mentioned
before.

This is contrary to fact.

Can this be elevated to a principle? How is 'spiritual quality'
measured? I'll take the 'spiritual quality' of most of Sirach over 
Joshua or Chronicles, any day.

What can I say? You believe what you believe- I'm asking for
a consistency check. I don't see that the books were added- in any
construction this formulation begs the question. No one can validly
ask me to 'have faith' that these books are noncanonical.

Compared to the Second Amendment?  I think it's worse.

The problem is, the devil is in the details.  You know, the Brady Bill
sounds like a ""good idea"" too, until you discover that there is NO check,
and that the police DON'T have to allow your purchase even if you check
out, and that you have NO recourse if they don't.

Are there any loopholes here?  I'm no lawyer, I can't be sure.  I
would have never noticed the second one mentioned above in the Brady
Bill, for example.

The more words involved, the more details.  What was that saying about
Abraham Lincoln requiring 200 words to free the slaves, and the modern
Congress requiring 3,000,000 words to describe price controls on rice?

That only works with bad laws.  Good laws are like good computer programs.

People are sucking up to the government when they decide that ONLY the
things the government says are plausible.  Especially if they refuse to
consider reasonable alternatives.

However, from what I saw plastered all over the TV news last night, it's
no longer necessary to be an ""independent thinker"" to depart from the
government's party line.  It looks like our ""independent press"" may 
actually be starting to be earn its clothes allowance.  This, to me, is
a good sign.  I hope it continues.

Independent thinkers question authority.  In a situation where only one
set of facts are being presented, ""coming to a conclusion"" is not the 
hallmark of an independent thinker unless it's coupled with the ability
to challenge those ""facts"" critically.  The scientific method consists
of more than choosing the popular hypothesis; it's even more than choosing
between two hypotheses that other people have proposed.

Hey, joe -- assuming you're old enough to remember it -- how did you feel
about presidential responsibility every time Reagan said ""I don't recall"" 
about his arms-for-hostages meetings with the Ollie North gang?

How did you feel about it when Bush said he ""was out of the loop on that

Indeed.  Larry King had the two attorneys (whose clients are now
dead) of Koresh and another Davidian on his show last night.  Their
discussions with the survivors differ from the FBI account.  The
attorneys say that they were told that the tanks knocked over lanterns
in the compound which started the fires.

Government spokespeople have lied and contradicted each other 
throughout this whole affair.  I'll wait for some better evidence before

Much of the dispute about the origin of the fire that destroyed the
BD compound could be settled by examining the propane tank supposedly
crushed by one of the army tanks when they breached the walls of the
compound. If the the propane tank is flattened and has tread marks on it,
then the BD's version of the cause of the fire would seem to be
verified.

The BATF is a part of the dept. of treasury, not justice.  If they needed
to assault a place they could just do like the IRS does...call in the
federal marshalls service, their fugitive collection teams do similar type
assaults all the time.  And they are very, very good about it, in both the
tactical and legal parts of it.  But I suspect that the marshalls would
not have touched it, because the search warrant (which is still sealed I
believe) was so bogus.  

Besides the BATF also could have gotton SWAT teams from: federal marshalls
service; FBI; secret service; national park service; texas rangers; nearby
large city police forces; the military.  But they had to use their own
guys, nobody elses SWAT team was good enough for the holy cause of gun
control.   

	I also find the timing of the raid to be extremely interesting. 
Initial raid: two days before the NJ senate was going to overturn their
""assault weapon"" confiscation law; a couple weeks before the BATF's budget
was going to come up in congress for review;  shortly after Reno got
confirmed as AG (I don't need to remind you about her anti-gun line);
right around the presidents 100th day in office.   As a wise man once

If Rush's criticism of Clinton were to be applied to Reagan and North... 
Reagan would have been impeached while North was convicted (and overturned on

Wait a minute.  The story being pushed here is that the fire started
in ONE PLACE.  This is not consistent with the story that they were
TRAPPED by the fire (particularly in a building that all of a sudden
had many more exits).

Choose one, please.

Well, for everyone besides Koresh and his blood children, we can 
assume independent choice: Ah, they chose to stay in the face of
an assault which clearly endangered their lives.  Or, alternatively,
they were not permitted to leave.  Choose one.

And you'd be wrong about that too.

Note that Texas isn't unique in this ""more with-gun deaths than
with-car deaths"", but some of the other states where it happens have
extremely strict gun laws.  Oops - so much for the ""meaning"".

That's half the question - the rest is ""and what do you get for your
sacrifice"".  If the answer to the second question is ""nothing"", as it
is for gun control, then we don't have to ask the first question
because getting nothing means that no sacrifice is justified.

OK... quick scenario... you're at home, not bothering anybody... next thing you
know, somebody comes crashing in the upstairs window and you hear an explosion.
You see that this individual has a submachinegun, and that more similarly armed
individuals are rushing your front door.  Will you a) defend yourself and family
against this attack b) realize ""oh, only the BATF would enter like that, so I 
better surrender"" or c) roll over and let whoever is attacking your home do
what they would like?  You have chosen a), and discover that the people you 
defended yourself against are federal agents, who now are camped outside your
door waiting for you to surrender.  You have learned that they intend to 
charge you with murder, and are further defaming your name, while claiming that
you can safely surrender at any time.  Then they start using psychological 
warfare techniques against you, while still claiming that you can safely give up
and will receive a fair trial.  Some weeks into this standoff, you are still
holding out, when they begin a new ploy to induce your surrender, namely using
tear gas to annoy you, and ramming your home with tanks.  Yet they claim that
you can safely surrender at any time.  While you patiently wait out this latest
round of attacks, your house catches fire and the bales of hay you were using as
cover spread the fire rapidly through the house, and you try to escape through
the fortifications you had raised for your own defense and the rubble created
by the tanks.  Only 9 of your followers make it.

I am not claiming that the above scenario is accurate.  I am disagreeing with
the notion that it is their own fault for dying because they refused to 
surrender to agents of the Federal government after another federal agency
committed an armed assault of their home on the basis of a flimsily concocted
search warrant.  

Look at how the Texas Rangers view the BATF.  Look at the FBI statements
regarding the BATF actions.  From all apparent sources, the FBI blundered
trying to clean up the mess made by the BATF, resulting in an accidental fire
which killed most of the BD's who were still in the compound, and are now 
playing CYA.  The BATF committed an illegal assault, obtained the use of 
Texas NG resources with fabricated allegations, and compounded their abuses
by accusing the BD's of crimes outside their jurisdiction once they had been
held off in their assault.

What if.......

What if the FBI thought that tear gas would force the Davidians out;
at least the mothers and the children, so they (the FBI) did not
bother to think about the effect of tear gas on young children......

What if the FBI knew they killed several of the children by using
tear gas......(let`s assume the FBI knew via their listening devices)

What if the FBI saw fire accidently break out at one end of the
building, e.g. by an upset oil lamp.......

What if the FBI thought they could finally force the rest of the
Davidians out AND also destroy the evidence that they (the FBI) had
killed the children by starting a fire at the other end......

What if the FBI miscalculated and not many of the rest of the Davidians
made it out.......?????

  If they had been quiet there would have been no deaths??  I thought thier
neighbors said that the Davidians never bothered them.  Oh, well, that couldn't
have been your point, then.  

  If they hadn't been stockpiling weapons, then the ATF wouldn't have felt 
threatened and had to move in.  Here's a newsflash:  It isn't illegal to
own more than one firearm.  It isn't even illegal to own *lots* of firearms.
 
  They shot federales?  The feds shot them, too.  

  How about that staying inside thing?  Here's another newsflash:  sometimes
the government does nasty things to you that you don't deserve.  Since
they were so nice to the Davidians the first time round, I can see why
the Davidians didn't surrender so easily, especially because they were
expecting the end of the world.

The IRS doesn't need to rely on the Federal Marshall's Services; the

The U.S. Government has become a garrotte around the necks of its
citizens.  Just as with a garrotte, the more people struggle to breathe
the air of freedom, the more the government tightens its stranglehold. The
only possible outcomes at this point are the death of government or the
elimination of personal freedom.

Hmmm.  You need to spend some time in a library, son.

When the Bill of Rights was written, in addition to the (muzzleloading)
shotgun and pistol you mention we had:

 - rifles in calibers ranging from around .30 to .69 caliber and up.
 - cannon with various different projectiles to choose from (and owned
   by civilians).
 - breech-loading rifles

In addition, semiautomatic and full-automatic firearms had been patented
and/or demonstrated by several people in various places during the preceding
century or so.

Sounds good.  Any refererences to this actually happening, or is it
just exaggeration for effect following one or more incidents of someone
firing a handful of shots from something that may or may not be an
Uzi, semi- or full-auto?

>Just because someting was good once, does not mean it will be forever.

Until the root conditions that justified it go away (criminal behavior,
either private or government, which should be defended against), there's
no reason it should go away.

The best reason to abolishing the ATF is that they don't have enough
to do.  If the organization were disbanded and its duties assigned to
the FBI (firearms) and IRS (tobacco and alcohol).  Both of these
organizations have enough to do.  The FBI is probably not going to try
to get a criminal charge of illegal machine gun for having a broken
gun.
 
There have been postings stating that law enforcement should be
divided and and weak.  But there is nothing more dangerous to
liberties than a law enforcement agency without enough criminals to
chase.  The ATF is one and look at the trouble it started in
Waco.

	shall not be infringed.

Now, notice, it says *arms*.  Not guns.  Arms.

The Comsymp ZOG wants you to think that it is the only legitimate
possessor of nuclear weapons.  Unconstitutional!  You and I have just
as much right to a kilogram or two of nice weapons grade plutonium as
any cruddy little pointy headed liberal Los Alamos pinkos.

Imagine, you have been under seige for almost two months by an enemy which you
believe wants to kill you.  Suddenly, they pump tear gas into your building and
punch holes in it with tanks.  Then a fire breaks out.  Do you run outside to
be slaughtered, or stay and face your fate.

Check Ethiopia vs. Italy in WWII for some answers to that question.

""Well Regulated"", at the time of its writing and in the context of the Second Amendment,
means ""Properly trained and equipped.""

It modern language it would read:

Subject: Photographers removed from compound
Nntp-Posting-Host: chopin.udel.edu
Organization: University of Delaware
Distribution: na
Lines: 48

Relay of coverage seen:
----------------------
There was a press conference by authorities at the compound on CNN earlier 
today (Wednesday).  It was explained that two news photographers were found 
on the compound earlier this morning without permission.  It was explained 
to the press corps. that this is dangerous and that an unknown photographer 
turning around with a long lens camera could be mistaken for someone dangerous 
by a Texas Ranger surveying the site. (!)  

The two photographers were said to be currently in jail and 
the press were warned to follow the authorities' guidelines.  
It was also emphasized that the survey of the ""crime"" scene at this 
point was crucial and that the press could not be allowed to interfere.
The press will not be allowed in until the bodies are removed and the 
site has been completely surveyed for evidence for a court case.  

That is the gist of the beginning of the conference to the best of my 
memory.  I bring this up because I haven't seen anyone else note it 
and I haven't seen the regular newscasts mention it.  It will 
probably be mentioned in the papers tomorrow.

My opinions:
-----------
I find this disturbing.  While I believe that Koresh is largely 
responsible for not ending this standoff in a peacable manner during the 
last 51 days of patient opportunity, I find the secrecy surrounding the 
aftermath more damaging to the authorities' position than they realize.

Since the vast majority of potential defendents in a court case are 
already dead, the emphasis on the importance of building the court 
case seems overblown to me.

It will be interesting to see the hearings on this affair.  I have also 
heard congressional calls for a review and possible overhaul of government 
enforcement agencies which you will recall I have stated would be a good 
idea in previous months.

Please also note that I by no means endorse  or agree with the many 
conspiracy-type theories I have read here and in other groups.  As usual, 
I am basing my opinions on info gathered from various media and filtered 
by my own common sense and consideration of plausibility, IMHO.  As such, 
my opinion is subject to change as more information is made available.

I keep hearing this, and while I'll agree that he ""should"" have come
out (legally, that was his best option), he didn't; and as far as I know,
there is no legal provision for ""we're tired of this shit, lets just
kick some ass...""

So I have a question for you; here goes.

I come up to you and point a gun at you, saying ""I'm going to count
to ten, if you aren't standing on your head by then, I'll kill you.""
You believe that standing on your head is the road to damnation, so
you don't do it.
""1..2..3..4..5..6..7..8..9..10...BANG!""  You are now dead - Is it my
fault for shooting you, or you're fault for being shot?
Koresh wouldn't stand on his head.

Interesting development.  Especially since the Feds (and the U.N.)
accused Saddam Hussein of using illegal chemicals on his own 
citizens as well.  Hmmm...  Republican Guard/Iraqu Army = FBI/BATF?

On TV news this morning it was reported that the local Texas authorities
who have reviewed the cases of the 21 children who were released
earlier in the siege have found no evidence of physical or sexual
abuse of any of the children.  I don't recall if this was on Good
Morning America or our local Texas TV station.

""Freed om of Religion"" has absolutely nothing to do with building a small
arsenal and grooming 10-year old children to be your wife. ""I'll come out
as soon as I finish my manuscript on the Seven Seals."" Oh, OK, David.

I agree that Koresh was as much of a victim as a perpetrator; this because
he grew up inside the cult, and engaged in a power struggle where his
supporters helped inflate his ego.

That doesn't change the fact that he was a loose fucking cannon with a
shitload of serious weapons. Or that he was banging thirteen year olds and
twisting their impressionable little minds.

This was no MOVE fuck-up. A helicoptor was thermal-imaging the compound
that afternoon and detected three fires erupting almost simultaneously.
There were no CS CANISTERS... a specially modified Abrams was pupming the
stuff in. No chance of starting a fire there. Kerosene lamps? Maybe one,
but not three fires. No way. Koresh wasn't just talking out of his ass. I
expected this to happen.

Maybe they WANTED it to look like murder. He had 50+ days. I think this was
coming the whole time. He didn't even put the children in the buried bus or
the underground bunker during the CS seige. He put them up into the tower
to die. Fuck all of you ""Big Brother"" paranoid freaks. The only good thing

Firearm?  Let's not even consider long knives (swords), which were also
common militia weapons in the 18th century, and which, if anything, are
often restricted more heavily than firearms.  Whatever sense gun control
makes, knife control makes even less.

They did have the proper equipment.  The problem is that they went about
things the wrong way.  The ATF should have served the warrant in a
peacable manner instead of going in there like a bunch of Rambos with
guns blazing.  I'm not trying to excuse what David Koresh did.  I'm
just saying that the ATF (henceforth to be known as the cigarette cops :-)
went about the ""raid"" in an improper manner.

Let the FBI, Customs, and local police officers do the ATF's job.  WE

Including you?  What if the cigarette cops kicked down your door and

Maybe they get the wrong address and then raid *your* home, for example.
It's happened before and it can happen *again*.  I have heard of more
than one instance of a no-knock raid going sour.  Just recently I
heard about a case in which police raided this guy's home because they
thought he had dope or something.  The guy blew both of the officers
away and he didn't go to jail for it.  The judge hearing the case
ruled that the man was acting in self-defense.

Are you sure that that would have been the way to go?  Surely the FBI
and ATF could have handled this fiasco better.  They didn't have to
massacre all those people.  As Stimpy said in ""Fake Dad"", ""Shame, shame,
double shame!""  The FBI and ATF should be ashamed of theirselves.

I noticed that too.  Special agent (asshole actually) Ricks stated that
David Koresh had ""explosives that could blow up an armored vehicle 40
feet into the air.""  It looked like to me that the BDs had plenty of
opportunity to use these explosives---provided that they had them in the
first place.  For example, when one of the tanks was injecting CS gas
into the ranch house (yes ranch house; the BDs weren't living in a
fortress) they could have easily destroyed or disabled that tank because
it was idling there for a considerable length of time.  So, why didn't
they do this?  Could it be that they didn't have any explosives or
similar munitions?  I just don't buy what the ATF and FBI have been
saying.  Hopefully, the truth will come out.

Here's something noteworthy:  after the fire had been burning for some
time an explosion occurred---just *one* explosion.  The media said that
this was some of the explosives that the BDs posessed going off.  I
don't think this was the case.  My brother and I noticed that this
so-called ""explosion"" resembled a plume of propane gas being ignited.
We figure that this is what it was because of how the ""explosion""
looked and sounded.  Obviously, it wasn't due to something like TNT,
dynamite, or C4.  I have seen a propane explosion before...the explosion
in the ranch house greatly resembled this.  Also, I noticed something
that looked like a propane tank in the charred ruble the next day.

Isn't it curious that the ATF wasn't very forthcoming about how the four
officers got killed?  Many weeks had gone by before they stated that
some of the officers had been killed and/or wounded by grenades thrown
by the BDs.  Earlier, when someone asked one of the spokespersons about
whether or not an autopsy had been performed on the slain agents, they
said that an autopsy had been done but THEY WEREN'T READY TO RELEASE
THE FINDINGS.  Now why is this?  Does the ATF have something to hide?
Perhaps those four agents were killed by friendly fire.  What is the
cause of death exactly?  NO ONE HAS EVER SAID WHAT IT IS.

What is certain is this:  ATF agents *did* throw grenades into the
compound.  As a matter of fact, Mr. Koresh handed his lawyer a grenade
body during one of the lawyer's visits to the compound.  Later on
the lawyer gave the grenade body (I don't know if it was a dud or a
spent one btw) to the ATF.  How much do you want to bet that this
grenade will mysteriously disappear?  At this point in time the only
people we know who had grenades was the ATF agents.  Wouldn't it be
a shocker if the no one ever found any evidence of grenades, rockets,
or explosives in the rubble?  The ATF would sure have egg on their
face then.  Note that the ATF is doing the *initial* sweep of the
rubble.  The FBI and the Texas Rangers won't investigate until the
ATF is done.  This looks like a perfect opportunity for the ATF to
make sure that others ""find"" what they want for them to ""find"" if
you know what I mean.  I'm probably being a little paranoid here
but if I am I have could reason to be.  Recall that several weeks
had gone by before anyone said that the BDs had used grenades.
Also recall that early on the ATF had *denied* that their agents
used grenades on the BDs.  Someone is lying here.

Well, I don't normally like to quote myself, but I just got some

OB ill-wind-and-all-that:  with Bill the Prez in there, at least the
anti-gunners are out of the closet.  The provision that any existing
so-called ""assault weapons"" die with their current owners was worked
into H.R. 3371 (102nd Congress bill number) a couple of years ago,
in a complicated way that the anti's claimed was a ""drafting error.""

Of course not. There's more than a little difference between formulating

As David Veal points out, this sort of ""promotion"" would be used
against gun owners by the mass media.

However, here is my proposal: offer gun safety classes in your area,
free, as a community service.  Such a class would normally cost $40
or $50, so offering it free is a good promotion.

Our Gun Club has organized several of these (we just finished
teaching another one last night, in fact) and they have been
very well received.  We get a lot of people who are novices
interested in guns.  We even get a few who are anti-gun, but
feel they should know something about ""gun safety"" since members
of their family keep guns at home.

Teaching such a course gives us many desirable benefits:

(1) We have the chance to teach gun safety rules; this increases
    firearm awareness and may help to reduce gun accident stats.

(2) A ""gun safety"" class is Politically Correct, and likely to
    be viewed positively by the public and the media.

(3) Most of the students are 'normal people' (not gun enthusiasts)
    and this kind of class gives us the chance to give them a
    gentle introduction to firearms.

(4) Some of the students are enthusiastic, and will purchase a gun
    and become more involved in shooting or personal defense.

(5) It improves the public perception of our club and gun owners
    in general.  Our students see that we are all reasonable,
    non-aggressive, soft-spoken people, which helps to mitigate
    the standard image of a hardcore gun owner.  Even anti-gun
    students sometimes tell us they have ""something new to think
    about"" with regards to personal gun ownership.

(6) Sharing our experience with others is a lot of fun.

Our course is the standard NRA-certified ""Home Firearm Safety""
class, and our students pay only $5 for materials.  We also
teach the NRA's ""Personal Protection"" class, although the cost
is higher for that one since we have to purchase range time.

I think firearms safety classes are an excellent response to
gun buy-backs.

        No, because ""we"" have decided that it doesn't make enough
difference to ""us"" to get up and do something.  That's something,
for instance, a lot of people who go speak against gun control
bills at their local government.  Dozens of ""pro-gun"" speakers
show up and few if any antis do, but  they often win anyway.
 
        Why?  Because it doesn't matter who shows up, it matters
who's willing to scream afterwards.  And it isn't that most people
give a damn one way of the other, but that they don't.  Nobody
gives a damn about anybody beyond their own little worlds.

Also no substantiation of your claim that Koresh said this.  I for one have

Up to which moment?  The one where you decided that anyone who claims to be

I have yet to see any evidence of *this*, either.  From what I hear the
*original* warrant (the reason for the Feb. raid) is still sealed.  What are
""unsealed"" seem to be warrants taken out after the initial raid.

>Then several parents come forward and demand that previous charges of child

Funny, I haven't seen any of these ""interviews.""
Interesting that when the social services agencies investigated Koresh on
these previous charges, they found absolutely no evidence of abuse.

> These parents claimed

Funny, I don't remember hearing anything about childrens' statements,
either.  Where did you say you heard all this?

What *I* heard was that none of the children who left the compound early in
the seige exhibited any signs typical of abuse, physical or mental.  This
from the newspaper and national TV news.

Did you also hear that it's the job of the BATF and the FBI to lay siege to
homes where child abuse is suspected?  I thought you did.

Your logic just amazes me.  I think your grandparents who died in

cavalierly you throw away people's protection of law because you think
they're ""scary"" and ""not the sort of person you'd want your daughter to

Will do! I appreciate the thoughtfullness of the Post to not be an
intermediary for such sales. The ""Right to bear arms"" is one of the most
misapplied rights in our Constitution, and assault weapons go way beyond
what is, or rather should be (imho), a ""natural"" right in America. Just
ask the family of that boy shot back in September - the papers are full of
stories about a child with an assult weapon with a ""angelic face"" (Post)
who committed the murder without ever thinking.

Then by your logic, the Jews in Europe in the 1930's were the cause for

You don't see any evidence of the abuse -- therefore it must be taking place?
As you point out everwhere but here, it is irrelevant to this case.  The
ATF is not in charge of investigating child abuse.

In obvious contradiction to the statements made by the F. B. I.

And just what are those actions that you are judging them by?
Their refusal to let the government control their lives? Their refusal
to submit to unconstitutional laws?  Their refusal to behave like
cowards?  Some of Texas' heros could have taken the cowardly way
out too and surrendered the Alamo.  After all, all they had to do was
COME OUT.  They stayed as you say by their ""OWN CHOICE"".  Problem
is not everyone chooses to act like a groveling dog in the face of
insurmountable odds.  But as you point out, they certainly do have
that right.

Bull.  They did, in fact, live a quiet, religious life -- as they claimed.
The warrant was not issued because they ""stockpiled weapons"".  It is
not against the law to own as many guns as you want -- yet (Except in 
Virginia).The warrant was issued for some ""gun parts"" that are about the size 
of a half-dollar.  Certainly worth the lives of so many people, don't you

Since neither side would be particularly interested in telling the truth,
you have to weigh the 'facts' given by each yourself, and weigh it with
the newsreporting if you care.

Many cult members will probably side with the attorney, and if he
is lying, change their stories to match his.  And if the Feds also
lie, the cult members who become disillusioned will change their
stories to match the Feds.  

Neither sides are interested in the truth.  The Media is more interested,
but usually either don't have the time to get it straight or tie themselves
to the ratings and deliberately distort.  

For me, though, the black soot billowing outside the compound added with
how fast the fire spread ponted to *someone* dousing large parts of the
compound with some sort of gasoline or fire-starter.  I doubt the Feds
did that as they were more interested in arresting Vernon.  The real
unbalanced one (at least the one that lost his cool) was Vernon, so
I figured that he was more likely to do it (after all he was Jesus 
being persecuted by the authorities, and had followers to hold onto,
so made the decision.  He and his followers also probably felt that they
were rocketing to heaven by doing this stuff).  Thsi conclusion, I came
to after umpteen million hours of listening to NPR and other radio
shows (I always have the radio going when I am in my office on some
innocuous talk-show or news program as background noise).

	As a matter of fact, I know it.

	There were several shootings recently in which the guns had
been purchased at the Baltimore Gunsmith, on Broadway - a favorite
place to get cheap ""popular"" pieces. By ""popular"" I am referring to
the kinds of guns our local youth gangs like: pistol grip shotguns,
cheap magnums, and Tec-9s.

My sig has generated more mail than any of my posts.

Robin Hood is a school financing plan wherein property rich school districts
will have a portion of their tax revenue taken from them and given to property
poor districts.  The laudable plan is to equalize the per student spending. 
IMHO, however, it is a disaster waiting to happen.  Taxes will go up in 50% of
the districts and we will lose control of how OUR tax money is spent.  It
penalizes districts that have excelled.

And the election is Saturday. Along with city council, school board and the
unfinished Senate term.  And after I exercise one right, I'm going to exercise
another!

Dunno if you'll find it in the Constitution, but that other document of American
liberty, that kids are taught to hallow in school, is the Declaration of
Independence.  That document is in fact a justification not just for the right
if revolution, but of the DUTY of revolution by the people, once the government
gets too oppressive.  It is a very radical document, and I recommend all
Americans... especially those in office... read it once a year.

Yes.  Given the history of the BD's and the fact that they were just 
peacefully minding their own business, I think this would have been
the correct course of action in the very beginning.  Everything that
followed was a direct result of the major media fuck-up that the BATF
perpetrated just over 51 days ago.

Yep, no doubt about it.  They should have just bombed those kooks
right from the git-go.  Yeah, sure!  So much for any resemblence
to an America that abides by the Constitution.  So much for feeling
safe in your home.  So much for any of the rights enumerated in the
Bill of Rights being upheld.  Why bother?  They just get in the way
of an effective government.  That is, a government of the elite, by
the elite, for the elite.  

Joe, attitudes like yours frighten me.  You have very few facts about
what actually happened, and what information you do have came from a 
single source, the FBI/BATF.  Yet you are more than happy to pronounce
the BD's guilty-as-charged based on this one-sided testimony.  Scary!

pete zakel is right, we don't need to worry about capitalization
rules. after all, the punctuation gives all the necessary information
about the sentence structure. why should anyone worry about whether the
text is as close to the original as possible. (sarcasm intended).

Then you didn't understand my grumble...  Again, I said to get a
CORRECT version of the Constitution.  The first indicator that
something is wrong (i.e. the copy has been modernized) is the modern
capitalization rules.  The next thing to go is the spelling, and then
I've even seen versions where the GRAMMAR was modernized (oh, but
don't worry, modernizing the grammar won't change the meaning of the
text, right?... ;-)  [p.s.  I have found about 10 *different* versions
of the Constitution on the network; And accuracy DOES matter...]

The Branch Davidians were not violent and were not planning to start
violence.
 
When the BD compound was assaulted by the ATF the BD did fire back.
But they agreed to a cease fire and they allowed the ATF to care for
their wounded.  The BD even released the ATF agents they captured.  It
is clear from the release of the agents and allowing the ATF medical
attention that the BD were not looking for trouble.
 
If the BD were violent they would have held the ATF agents as
hostages.  They would not have released them like they did.  If they
had kept the agents hostage they could have used them as bargening
chips for medical attention etc.
 
A big thing is being made of the BD collection of weapons but no one
has shown that they had any plans to use them.  It is also apparent
that the BD did not have any military training.  If they had, they
could have dug bunkers and trenches and increased their
fortifications.  They could have shot out the lights and speakers.  It
appears that the BD were not violent, they shot back at the attacking
ATF agents out of panic.  There were shots fired on the last day but
they were in response to the FBI attack on the compound with armor.
 
All the violence in Waco was initiated by the federal agents, not the
BD.

What is ""doing it right the first time""?  Murdered them all?  Used tanks? 
Maybe they should have had enough evidence to indict.  From the list presented
to date, I haven't seen ANYTHING illegal.  They claim that the BD's bought
components to convert their weapons to Class III devices, but no evidence that
they had done so.  In fact, with a Class III FFL living with them, this may
have been legal (given recent court rulings).

What you really meant to say was that the ATF should have done the right and
lwaful thing.  Or did you just want the BD's dead?

Pardon me, here, but I don't trust Spectre's motives here at all.  Spectre

Right on the money here.  We should certainly applaud the disbanding of the

There it is.  The Constitution isn't for ""sociopaths"", only ""normal""

I keep hearing this, but every assertion of this form has come from
government sources except two.  As far as I am concerned, I am not
ready to stipulate that Koresh EVER promised to come out except for
his first promise and his last promise.

The first promise was conditional on his audio tape being given 
NATIONAL exposure.  Well, it never was -- it was broadcast locally,
in a chopped-up fashion, and that's all.  And even then, they cleverly 
cut it off when it got to the part where he demanded ""national exposure,""
but not so cleverly that we didn't hear it.

The last promise was conditional on the finishing of his manuscript.
We'll never know if he would have kept that one.

Strangely enough, the previous day they said they were prepared to

Quite possible.  But arguments of intent do not mark the dividing 
line between guilt and innocence -- only the line between murder and 
negligent manslaughter.

It's too tempting for one or more of the survivors to ""go state's
evidence,"" parrot the FBI story, hang the whole ""suicide"" on Koresh, 
claim they only stayed at gunpoint, etc.  If any of them do this
in the next few weeks, it doesn't prove much; but if none of them
do, it would be a strong indication to me that the FBI story is
dead wrong.

CNN just reported the ATF and the FBI have begun killing everyone in the
United States. A press release stated this action was required because
bugs had revealed that many people were doing something illegal in their
homes, and statistical data indicated that those who weren't might someday
do something illegal. An ATF spokesperson, just before he shot himself, stated
that ""this would clean up things once and for all"".

If the citizens can be gathered into groups of more than 100, the FBI has
indicated they will ""burn them, just like we did those kooks in Waco"". 
It hasn't been decided how the new proposed ""energy tax"" will enter into
this, an IRS representative stated ""We're looking at the tax code to determine
if taxes really end at death. With this many dead Americans, we don't want
to overlook anything"". An ATF agent ran into the room, and shot her.

Assuming the fire was caused by lanterns and stoves being knocked about
by the tanks pushing on the walls (would shake a building pretty good)
perhaps they didn't flee because fleeing would have meant ENTERING the
fire from the other side?  Like they were surrounded by the fire, and
rubble, which finally (combined with teargas, and combustion gasses)
overcame and enveloped them?

In other words they were TRAPPED by the flames, heat, fumes and rubble?

Does that sound plausable?  Not as dramatic as Korash forcing them to
stay, or shooting them (no shot victims found yet), but plausable...

CCW's are issued at the discretion of the police chief, so it varies
town by town.

In my town, forget about anything more than ""target and sport"" (carry to
and from the gun club / hunting area only) unless you're Mr. Moneybags

now, that's important."")  In other towns, they treat law abiding citizens
like adults.  

Secret game hint: you never know when the rules will be changed -- a change 
in police chief can throw a town from either side of the board to the other
-- fun for the whole family!

Some chiefs will grant you a ""personal protection"" permit if you have been
attacked or threatened.  Some other blue-suited assholes have been known to 
count this as a NEGATIVE against applicants.

It's a crap shoot, and your rights are the stakes.

This is really uncalled for.

You cannot expect a European, growing up in a culture of ""rulers"" and

and citizen sovereignity in the US.

He's less at fault than the countrymen we have here who also can't grasp it.

I suspect we saw the latter.  However, the injustice implied in letting

Folks,

It's time to start building some precise questions to send to our
federal elected officials and to investigative reporters in our
local TV, radio and newprint media.  Ideally, these questions could be
asked at any investigation into the BATF's and FBI's participation
at the WACO fiasco in hopes of being resolved and, hopefully, wake
up the local news media that they are not getting the entire truth
from the BATF and FBI.  My list is up to 13 that are really nagging 
at my gut.  The list will probably grow. 

1.   What were the contents of the original warrant, now sealed, that
     the BATF obtained?

2.   It is reasonable to believe that illegal firearms and/or ammunition
     could not be flushed down the toilet.  Therefore, a ""no-knock""
     raid could be ruled out.  Prior to the initial assault on the 
     complex, did a single BATF agent and accompanying witness (without 
     a contingent of assault and news media personnel) attempt to knock 
     on the door of the Branch Davidian's complex and serve the warrant 
     in a manner prescribed by law?

3.   On the day of the initial assault on the complex, BATF agents
     were aware that several small children were inside the buildings.
     In the ensueing gun battle, BATF agents fired into a building
     known to contain children, killing at least one two-year old child.
     Knowing children were present, why didn't the BATF have an
     alternate plan and immediately retreat from the area close to
     the complex and implement the alternate plan rather than opening
     fire and jeopardizing the lives of the children in the building? 

4.   The FBI spokesman states that paper evidence indicates that
     David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians possessed over
     $200,000 in firearms and ammunition.  Did David Koresh and the
     members of the Branch Davidians have a valid Federal Firearms
     License, were they actively participating in the legal business
     of selling/buying firearms and ammunition, and were any of the
     weapons they had illegally possessed?  Does this paper evidence
     consist only of weapons purchased or does it include legally
     dispossessed weapons.

5.   After the original assault on the compound tragically failed,
     a BATF spokeswoman stated ""We were outgunned!"".  Yet, TV newscasts
     of video tape filmed at the time of the incident show BATF agents
     armed with MP-5 and AR-15/M16 rifles.  Although unclear on the
     video tape because of obstruction from full view by agent's
     bodies, they also may have had AK-47 and SKS rifles.  What type(s)
     of firearms did the BATF agents have immediate access to at the 
     scene of the original assault on the complex?

6.   Since there is no evidence to confirm anyone was inside the
     complex involuntarily, why did the FBI treat it as a ""hostage""
     situation? 

7.   Along the same lines, why did the FBI use ""psychological warfare""
     techniques, including sensory overload, sleep deprivation, and
     other disruptive techniques that would test the sanity of any 
     normal person rather than using techniques aimed at placing the 
     complex occupants into a calmer frame of mind?

8.   Reports indicate several of the children inside the complex
     were accompanied by their mothers.  Since it is reasonable
     to expect these mothers would have their children taken away
     from them if they came out, why did the FBI expect the mothers
     to just walk out and surrender themselves to the authorities?

9.   Agents at the scene claim to have seen members of the Branch
     Davidians setting fire to the complex.  Branch Davidian members
     who survived the inferno claim the fire was started when an 
     armored vehicle punched through the wall and knocked over a 
     lantern which was setting on a table.  Video tape of the incident 
     does show an armored vehicle punching a hole in the wall and the 
     fire erupted almost immediately from the same general location.  
     Was the source of the fire the same room where the armored vehicle 
     penetrated?

10.  FBI spokesmen are voicing the opinion that the David Koresh and
     the members of the Branch Davidians committed mass suicide.  Yet,
     bodies are being discovered throughout the house and other areas
     within the building complex.  This seems to be counter to any
     known mass suicides through history.  What evidence does the FBI
     have that a mass suicide pact existed?

11.  FBI Director Sessions stated that the massive fireball shown on
     the video tape was caused by the Branch Davidian's ammunition
     and/or powder cache exploding.  Yet, the fireball seems to be
     more characteristic of the type created when compressed gas
     or other highly volatile fuel source explodes.  Was any evidence 
     found which would indicate the Branch Davidians had an ammunition 
     and/or powder cache which exploded to create this fireball?  If so,
     and if David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians were 
     engaged in the legal business of selling/buying firearms, was the
     amount determined to be excessively greater than one would expect
     for someone engaged in such a legal business?

12.  It is rumored that one FBI agent was extremely upset about critical
     news media coverage and intentionally used an armored vehicle to
     crush a reporter's car which had been left at the compound.  Is 
     there any factual basis to this rumor and, if so, what charges will 
     be brought against the FBI agent who performed the act?

13.  FBI Director Sessions states that, during the final assault on the
     complex, ""over 80 shots were fired at the vehicles.""  On the video
     tape of the incident, you can hear the drone of the armored vehicles
     engines.  Yet, there is no sound of the sharp reports that one
     would expect to hear if shots were fired.  Also, there are no 
     indications of smoke and/or muzzle flashes appearing from the windows,
     buildings or other structures in the video.  Surely, these should be 
     evident if the Branch Davidians had fired on the armored vehicles.  
     Finally, the video tape does not show any indication of paint splatter, 
     sparks or other characteristic spray of material which should be 
     apparent if the Branch Davidians had fired upon the vehicles.  Do 
     any of the armored vehicles which were brought in to pump tear gas 
     into the compound show evidence of fresh damage due to being hit by 
     shots from high-power rifles?

14.  CS gas is considered to be a chemical warfare agent.  The United
     States has signed international treaties which prevent the use
     of CS gas in warfare.  If the United States could not morally use
     CS gas against Saddam Hussein and his troops, why is it morally
     acceptable to use the same agent against citizens of our own land?

15.  On April 21, FBI spokesmen state that at least 3 bodies discovered
     in the complex had bullet wounds to the head indicating they had
     been murdered or had committed suicide.  On April 22, the county
     coroner claims he knows nothing about any bodies found with bullet
     wounds to the head.  Were any of the victims bodies found within
     the burned out complex have bullet wounds to the head?

freedoms that belong to human beings. They would support the
Jews against the Nazis or anyone else who tries to oppress them

Mentioning that Turkic people are wide-spread means desiring a Turkish empire?
Is that the logical thing to conclude from a statement like that? 
To me it just says that Turkey may have economical benefits from that
if she can be competitive enough. No more than that. But of course
you have the freedom of extrapolating as you wish from any statement.

One question: In what context did Ozal use the words you are quoting?

Note - you are already posting ""facts"", some of which are outdated.

The biased presentation of facts, as well as the conclusions that
you reach leave me little hope of engaging in any fruitful
exchange that might lead to a ""meeting of the minds"".  It is to those
who read with open mind, that I address myself.

%The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
%Racial Discrimination adopted by the General Assembly of the
%United Nations in 1965, has now been ratified by most member
%states. Article 1 of this Convention defines the term racial
%discrimination as ""any distinction, exclusion, restriction or
%preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic
%origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing
%the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of
%human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic,
%social, cultural or any other field of public life.""

While the ideals embodied in this text are worthy goals,
as the text currently stands I know of no country in which
racial discrimination of some sort can not be found.
It makes no mention of the need for for a legislative
violation.

%The General Assembly endorsed in 1975 a resolution defining
%Zionism as a form of racism and racial discrimination. The
%important, correct and legitimate resolution is incomplete since
%it does not include operative statements designed to end Israeli
%racial discrimination. Meanwhile the United States, on behalf of
%Israel, are exerting heavy pressure on member states of the United
%Nations to repeal this resolution and give Israeli racial
%practices - Zionism - moral legitimacy.

If you are, in principle, advocating UN intervention via operative
statements in this case, it must therefore hold that they can be
applied to any other case where the council perceives some form
of racial discrimination as previously exhibited.

Scarey thought.

%The very definition of Israel as a State belonging to the Jews of
%the world (but not to its inhabitants), alienates all native
%non-Jews born in that country. 

Actually, I know quite a few native non-Jews born in Israel that are not
alienated by this law.  If you had said some, you would probably be
correct, however your tendency to exagerate and slant facts becomes
apparent.  This slant permeates the text.

%Practically all non-Jews who are living in or originate from areas
%under Israeli control, identify themselves as Palestinians. Most
%of them are Muslim, many are Christian. A few Jews, including the
%author of these lines, also identify themselves as Palestinians.

The above statement is not true.  Practically all - discounting
Beduins, Circassians, Druze, and some other fringe groups.
Your own identification is a matter that has no bearing upon the
issue.  You could equally identify yourself as a [insert group].

%Zionism took off in Europe at the end of last century. It's aim
%was to create a Jewish state in Palestine in spite of the adamant
%opposition of Palestinian Arabs (95% of the population).

If I recall correctly, at the time ""zionism"" took off, there
was no adamant opposition in Palestine.  I am open to any
factual contradictory evidence .

%But the
%Zionists were more powerful, militarily, economically and
%technologically, and succeeded in 1948 in conquering 70% of the
%area of Mandatory Palestine. After driving into exile most native
%Arabs from the conquered areas, approximately 750,000 people, and
%razing most of their villages to the ground, the Zionists could
%finally establish a predominantly Jewish State. Only 150,000
%non-Jews remained on Israeli territory.

Do you therefore contend that the 400 villages you mention further on ""most
of their villages""?

%Once the Jewish State was established, it began enacting laws to
%help the confiscation of land from native non-Jews, their
%political repression and their destitution.

There is no doubt that laws passed provided a framework which was later
used for these purposes.  However, you seem to imply that this was the
intention a priori, which implies a policy and agenda.  My knowledge was
that this was not the case.

You also neglect to mention the circumstances that surrounded
this.  As you do again, below.

%In 1967 the State of Israel invaded Egypt and Syria and occupied
%the rest of Palestine (the West Bank and the Gaza strip). Thus
%another 1.5 million Palestinians fell under its juridiction. Its
%occupation of Palestinian and other Arab territories is considered
%illegal by the international community, as reflected in Security
%Council resolutions. Israel has rejected all U.N. resolutions and
%began without delay to entrench its occupation and rule over these
%territories with the aim of annexing them at the appropriate time.

Not quite accurate.  Israel has not rejected all the resolutions,
though it has conflicting understanding with regards to some of them.
Israel never annexed the Sinai, West Bank, or Gaza.  The other
annexations were brought about partly due to the UN resolutions.

%Part of these territores, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights,
%have already been forcefully annexed by Israel, in defiance of
%international law and UN resolutions.

Out of curiousity, provided that the annexees are granted citizenship,
what int'l law do you claim prohibits annexation of territories
captured in war?  Has this ever been applied to any other country
previously (other than Iraq) ?

%It must be emphasized that, although these people live under
%different regimes, they are united in their self-perception as
%Palestinians, that is as people identifying with Palestine, a
%territorial entity (not an ethnic or religious entity).

Incorrect! Palestinians themselves claim to be discriminated against
on an ""ethnic or racial"" basis.  Therefore your above statement is
incorrect.

I also note that given the previous definition of racial discrimination,
the only means that you could argue for that is nationalistically.
However, no such nation has existed.  It definitely did not exist
at the time of the creation of Israel, in which case you can not
argue racial discrimination during that period!

%Furthermore Palestinians generally consider the PLO both as a
%symbol of national identity and as the unchallenged authority that
%represents them in world affairs.

Once again, some do, some don't.

%The non-Jewish population living in the Palestinian and other Arab
%territories occupied by Israel in 1967 suffers not only blatant
%discrimination but is subject to brutal military occupation.

Another generalization, but then again, you don't seem to care
about anyone other than the Palestinian people, whose cause you
espouse.

%licence, to start a business and to buy industrial equipment, the
%right to educate children, all of these basic rights are subject
%to arbitrary rulings by military authorities and cannot be
%challenged in court.

Incorrect once again.  They have the ability to appeal.
Furthermore, although you may not agree with them, not all
of the military rulings are senseless or arbitrary.  Some
are, but this is not due to the ""whims"" of the military as
much as the sizeof the task/organization.

%Only Jewish inhabitants of the occupied
%territories are permitted to carry firearms.

Incorrect once again.  I know two Arab policemen who lived in
Daheisha and there were more.  Of course, with the outbreak of
the intifada they were forced by the locals to resign, bitterly.

%Jewish settlers have
%right to 6-7 more water per person than non-Jews. Jewish residents
%of these territories number now about 100,000 people. It is Israel
%governmentUs policy to increase this number substantially, in
%total defiance of international law, UN resolutions and the will
%of the population. The State of Israel systematically confiscates
%land from non-Jewish inhabitants of these territories for Jewish
%settlement.

That is no longer true, and I can't help but wonder what your
purpose is/was in posting this.

%Some 800,000 people in Israel proper,are not Jews. Most of them
%consider themselves Palestinians with Israeli citizenship. For
%many years after the establishment of Israel they were subjected
%to harsh military control. Much of their land was confiscated by
%the State and handed to Jewish organisations for exclusive Jewish
%settlement. They have been subject to massacres, destitution and
%humiliation. While they enjoy, with Jewish Israelis, the right to
%vote, they are discriminated against both through law and in
%practice.

Once again, to hell with the other minorities that don't fit in,
right?  Their are many villages who did not suffer in the way
you seem to indicate, Abu Gosh comes to mind.  Yes, some did but
as a result of what actions?

%Approximately 92% of the surface of the State of Israel within the
%Rgreen lineS is for all purposes closed to Palestinians who are
%second-class citizens in Israel. They may neither legally live on
%such land, nor rent or cultivate it. A direct effect of these
%policies is that native non-Jewish citizens of Israel are denied
%residence and membership rights in most rural communities in
%Israel, including the collective settlements, kibbutzim. Non-Jews
%are discriminated against in many other ways: The Government
%starves local authorities of Palestinian villages and townships of
%funds; Jewish city councils force Palestinians to live in ghettos;
%Jewish families receive higher child allocations than their
%non-Jewish neighbors, Palestinian schools suffer underfunding and
%understaffing (as compared to Jewish schools); Palestinian
%children are denied the right to learn their history and
%literature; Israelis who struggle for equal rights and for the end
%of racial discrimination, suffer continuous harassment by the
%authorities.

1.  There are some kibbutzim with Arab/Non-Jewish members.
    It is up to the members of the kibbutz.  There is no
    legislation against it, nor against a purely non-Jewish
    collective.

2.  Funds are the result of political lobbying.  Bearing in mind
    that non_Jews compose ~20% of the voting population, it has
    never failed to amaze me that they fail to form one large
    bloc, and increase their power.  The recent elections are a case 
    in point.

3.  Please provide factual evidence supporting your allegation
    with regard to educational material.  You have obviously
    never seen the curriculum of a school in the West Bank.
    It is based upon Jordan's school system.

4.  With regard to your last statement, it is simply another
    gross generalization.  

%The State of Israel refuses to acknowledge itself as the State of
%all its inhabitants.  Although the Israeli Cabinet has never
%openly endorsed the 'transfer' idea (the forced removal from the
%country of its native Palestinian population, that is, its
%ultimate Judaization), Israeli government policies towards
%non-Jews bear the mark of this 'Final Solution'. No attempt is
%made by the Zionist authorities to integrate Palestinian Arabs
%into Israeli public life. Thus, although comprising approximately
%17% of the population of Israeli citizens, no Palestinian citizen
%of Israel has ever served as Cabinet member, as director of 
%ministry or of a national institution, as judge of the Supreme
%Court, as ambassador of Israel, or in any leading position in
%Israeli economic or financial life. Even the director of the
%Ministry for Arab Affairs - yes, such a thing exists! - is a Jew.

Another generalization, but lets not stop here.
The transfer idea was espoused by one party in the last gov't,
Moledet.  It was intended to be a solution to the problem in the
territories, not the country itself.  With regard to other items,
I recall at least one Arab ambassador, and the rest was covered
previously.

%Although sexual
%relations between and cohabitation of Jews and non-Jews are legal,
%they are considered by Israeli/Zionist society somewhat a betrayal
%of the Jewish and Zionist ethics. The Israeli educational system
%nurtures this attitude in a systematic way.

When was the last time you were in Israel?  That is simply not true,
nor has it been for quite some time.  The question of religious
intervention is best answered by the proportional representation and
the lack of any Arab party bloc to counter the orthodox one.

%Zionism rejects the idea of a modern secular state, based on
%equality of all citizens. This is one main reason why Israel has
%not produced any written Constitution. 

Simply incorrect.
The answer is political.  Once again, your failure to understand the
dynamics and movements inside Israeli gov't, relegates your
contentions to the sidelines.

%Zionism predicates a state
%where Jews have privileged rights. Thus, according to Israeli law,
%a Jew born in London, who has never visited Israel, does not speak
%Hebrew and professes atheism, is granted automatic Israeli
%citizenship, while native Palestinian inhabitants who happen to be
%Christian or Muslim, are treated almost as aliens.  Racial
%discrimination, as defined in international law, is thus not only
%reflected in Israeli laws and policies, but is grounded in the
%very nature of Israel as a Jewish state.

But the discrimination is not based upon race.
Oops, sorry, nasty habit I have of countering malicious false truths.

%Any proposal for Israeli-Arab and Israeli-Palestinian peace that
%does not address the issue of racial discrimination by Israel -
%that is the Zionist nature of the State of Israel - is thus doomed
%to fail.

Real world intrusion - any proposal that does is doomed to fail.
Of course, I wouldn't expect you to understand, wrapped up as
you are in your VIEW of things.  Let's not let anything penetrate
shall we!?!  I may be a bit too sarcastic but there is a limit to the
amount of patience I have for rubbish at 02:00.

You knew that didn't you? Perhaps you might want to add up all the Jewish

While we are talking about this man I have included more of his testimony

No doubt he was lying right Harry?

                 which was then unknown in the country,

Thanks for teaching us about the civilized world, Andi.  I guess we all just 
came out either the desert or the ghetto, right?  And no, we are not paid
Israeli lobbyists nor are we conspirators of the ZOG - we are just people who
believe in our cause and find offense when people imply some sort dirty dealing

Oh!  Thank you!  I needed your approval of my heritage.  I guess I can go home

  No, but you're right that I didn't express myself well.

  The dialog went:

  IMHO, the Josh's policy of forwarding the garbage in question,

There is no doubt that Israeli authorities ordered the destruction of
mosques in the vicinity of the Wailing Wall. That does not mean,
however, that once can generalize from this to any other points.  The
entire plaza, mosques and all, was cleared to make it possible for Jews
to have a place to worship in the place that was holiest to many of
them, and which had been denied to them for millenia.

On the other hand, throughout the rest of Jerusalem and Israel, to the
best of my knowledge, Israeli authorities have scrupulously avoided
damage to any Islamic religious sites. This contrasts with the policies
of previous regimes which destroyed Jewish synagogues out of hate and
bigotry.

When I was in Jerusalem a couple of years ago, our guide told
us the story of that mosque - not sure if it was true.

Apparently, it was built by a Jewish convert to Islam.  He had
had a dispute with his neighbours, and built the mosque ""davka"" to
annoy them.  It's a cute story, but not sure if it's true...

disposal for our journey, I foresaw it would have to become
our headquarters for a considerable time, and therefore went
to some trouble to make it habitable. We had a most peculiar
little locomotive, originally built in America for the Russian
Government, adapted to burn either wood or oil; one covered
truck as men's quarters; one similar, which I fitted up for my-
self and a railway officer; and also a truck to carry wood, three
cars being the utmost our small engine could pull. With this
small outfit we started, rumours of all kinds reaching us before
our departure indicating that the whole situation was rapidly
coming to a head, it being evident that the Turks were becoming~
more and more restive in the face of the inexplicable delay of
the Allies in reaching any definite decision with regard to the
future.

Travelling on this little ""war-time"" railway was indeed an
experience, and it was necessary to carry a ""gauge,"" and to
test the rails with it frequently, for in many places, owing to
the sinking of the embankments and the washing away of the
ballast, the rails required rectification before we were able to
get our train over, even at a foot pace; each bridge also re-
quired elaborate examination before adventuring the train upon
it, and eventually we were obliged to carry large baulks of tim-
ber to temporarily shore up many of the bridges and culverts
whilst we passed over them.

Under these circumstances it may be imagined that our prog-
ress was by no means rapid, and as we had frequently to halt
also to replenish our supply of wood fuel, we considered we
had achieved wonders when, on the evening of the second day,
60 hours and 70 miles out from Erzeroum, we finally entered the
gorge of the mountains where we understood our worst troubles
to lie. This is the same gorge into which the road from
Erzeroum to Kars descends from the foot-hills to cross the
frontier; the railway, however, follows the main Aras River val-
ley till the frontier gorge enters it, whilst the road cuts off the
corner and joins the rail again at the frontier post of Zivin,
some 15 miles from the main valley.

Soon after entering the gorge, we were confronted by the
first serious fall of rock--about 2,000 tons having fallen from
the cliff face and entirely obliterated the railway track. Here,
therefore, we halted, and, sending our engine back, prepared to

There is nothing you need to defend yourself against. As I said:
I just exchange ideas over the USENET with other people. I never 
attacked you as to put you in the need to defend yourself against me.
I am not a violent person, and I do not see how can anyone be threatened
by the opinions and ideas of others as expressed on USENET.
I asked you to continue on email because I am not interested on a
flamefest, where you change my words or just make up some of your own
and present them as mine.
So, do not worry. You do not need to defend yourself because I am not
attacking you.

	Do you have a problem with the language? I said
everyone suffered emotionally because they sympathyzed with the
victims of Holocaust. I wasn't implying that anyone suffered
more than the actual victims. Neither was I implying any
wrongdoing on the part of the Jews as the cause for the
Holocaust. What is wrong with you guys? Regardless of what one 
says you keep hearing what you want to hear.

That is no problem.  But once again you are defining Zionism as *ONE*
movement.  You are implying that it is monolithic.  You *KNOW* this is
not and has never been the case.

You don't say it directly.  You implied it, and I showed explicitly

What you said is that ""Judaism is defined according to religious
standards.""  Now this can have several different meanings, and you know
it.  One of the meanings that it can have is to say that ""Only those who
are religious are defined as Jews"".  Another is to say that ""Only those
who meet the religious definition of a Jew is one.""  And there are
others.  I'm not twisting your words.  I'm trying to make you aware that
your words don't mean what you think they do.

It'll depend on what religion is practiced in the house.  The original

memory serves.

Not Jewish.

No you didn't.  You had to twist the definition of the word 180 degrees

Duh.  As a scientist, whose technical terms are very often not found in

hypocrisy, a good dictionary can be regarded as an authoritative source.

>Third, we can exchange ideas if you want, but you come out with this nonsense

It's not nonsense.  When people read what you write, they have to try to
associate a meaning to those words.  Dictionaries give the meanings of
words, don't they?  Now, I assume that you'd like to have the words you
use mean what you'd like them to.  But the fact is, you're using very
different meanings than are in the dictionary, or you would like the
reader to assign them new meanings, which they never had.

Poppycock.

I read what you said.  I did not add anything.  You simply either don't
know that the words don't mean what you'd like them to - which cannot be
the case now since you've been proven wrong and you quite obviously
don't have a defense against the arguments presented, or you're twisting
the meanings.  Which is it?

I'm not sure about this but I hope the answer is that you can't apply under

Jewish nation.

At the moment you converted, you officially anounced to the world that *you* do not

consider you to be a member?

No.  As a result of wars brought by the Arabs against the Jews in an attempt to
annihilate Israel, the Arabs have lost their claim to land there.  Attacking Israel
is/was illegal and they now have to pay the price.  Do I feel sorry for the
Palestinians?  Yes I do.  But I blame the Arab nations for their problems, not

Precisely, why not Cuba??  Why not???  The Hatians are being ruled by thugs 
and their elected leader has asked support to reestablish the peoples will.  If 
the U.S. or any other democracy wishes to, they are in the perfect right to 
help them without any whining from thir parties.  After all if it turns out to 
be colonialism and the poeple don't like it, they' find a way to throw them out.

Who ever said people who commit genocide have the right to commit genocide??  
I want a world where criminals agains humanity have no place to hide, while you 
want special sovereignties designed to protect them.  Nobody has the right to 
commit crimes against humanity, and if they do they loose all right to self 
determination.  If this is classical colonialism, then so be it.

I could give you hundreds of words in my mother tongue (Spanish), that

could show you a lot of meanings that words in Spanish have different
from those in the dictionary.

And guess why. Isn't it curious that we do not know how many people define 
in how many different ways the term Jew, which is the basis of the movement 
itself?
So, the evidence shows that up to now, Jew, when considered in terms of Israel,
the Law of Return and Jewish Nationality is defined in terms of religion and
not of cultural identity, even if 80% of those defined as Jews in Isreal
are not religious.

That IS a problem. I am saying that I do not support Zionism as it is
now. I believe that among the people in the Soviet Communist Party some
might even had been inspired by noble ideals. Does that change the
final results of what happened in the USSR?
In the same way, even if the Zionist movement is not homogeneous, it
does not matter. What matters is the result.

I never said it directly nor indirectly. I am not talking about individuals
who defined themselves as zionists here. I am sure most of them are good,
honest and caring people. I am talking about the results of the Zionist
Movement. I am talking about a Movement whose actions resulted in a
Law of Return with a religious definition of Jew, a country that defines
nationality based on religion. I am talking about something I consider
a form of racism such as differenciation based on religious belief. 
After all, if Arabs in Israel cannot serve in the Army is becasue they 
were not born in the ""right"" religion.

I had never heard the definition: Only those who are religious are defined as Jews.
I had always seen the definition: A person is a Jew is his/her mother is/was
a Jew, and if such person does not convert, although I had seen people
argue about the last part.

So, there is no difference between citizenship and nationality in Israel?

You do not need to assume the representation of ""everybody else"" to 
make your points. You should assume that you are just talking for yourself.
About the other stuff, I still believe that the example was a valid one.
It would be a hypocrisy to say that one supports nationalism for all and
then support Zionism and then disregard the Palestinian's right.

Not really. I posted in another post the definition of Zionism. And, in
this post you have showed for me what I was telling you from the 
begining. Zionism is a form of racism, even if most zionists are not
racist in their individual and private lifes. A movement that ask
for a State and National rights for a people, and then in practice,
that people are defined according to religion is, for me, racist-like.

Thanks for posting the references. I do not normally read t.p.m.,
and I posted my request for references because Jim's article
was cross-posted to soc.culture.jewish. Allegations of Jewish
disrespect for the objects and buildings of other religions are
one of antisemitic stereotypes that permeate western culture, and
rumors of church and Host desacration probably caused more pogroms
than blood libel. The stereotypes that pervade our culture create
cognitive illusions that reify those stereotypes. Therefore any
claim that appears to reify a stereotype should be treated by
decent people with utmost suspicion until and unless documented.
If such a claim is cross-posted to a news group in which it has
not been documented before, such as s.c.j, a reference should be
given the first time it appears.  Now that the claim has been
documented, I regard the whole episode as disgusting and
shameful. Especially so because the official who failed to
provide proper temporary facilities for the evicted Jordanians
was probably Jewish, and as a Jew I know that he should have
known better.

Well, -I've- been reading t.p.m. for a while and here is what I saw
YOU write:

In article <EGGERTJ.93May4220241@moses.ll.mit.edu> you wrote:

  >For balance, perhaps you should mention the mosques in Jerusalem that

Your statment clearly tries to ""balance"" Arab atrocities by noting a
single incident by the Israelis in war-time at their most holy site.
You even characterize it as ""an eye for an eye"".  

You also wrote:

  >That would be false.  If you read your history, you will learn that

so now you have to find some source that notes that more than 1 mosque
was razed.  You then followed it with:

  >This episode is an example of a good government running amok with
  >newly acquired power.  

Really?  Do you still feel that Israelis are comparable in the running
amok with power with, say, the Iraqis?  Your ""eye for an eye""
comparisons don't match the realities that most of us are familiar
with.

>Quoting from The West Bank Story, pages 35-36:

This happened to be during a war!  And a fierce and mighty war it was,
too.  Would you say that the Jordanians ""indiscriminately shot up
ancient structures as is their custom"" in describing bullet holes in
the walls of the city?  This was war!  It was certainly not any ""eye
for an eye"" characterstic.  Israelis do not harbor the same feelings
of revenge as the Arabs generally do.  This is one of the reasons that
the Peace Now movement exists in Israel and nowhere else in the M.E.

You're just beginning to scratch the surface.  Do you know how much
military equipment costs?  When was the last time you tried to buy a
mil-spec hammer, coffee-pot or toilet seat?  

Paying Israel to do the dirty work on it's own without putting
American soldiers's lives on the line is much, much, much cheaper than
Uncle Sam's arrangements with much of the rest of the world.

DEPOSITION OF KARINE BORISOVNA MELKUMIAN [1]

Born 1963
Teacher
Boarding School No. 1

Resident at Building 2B, Apartment 21
Block 41A
Sumgait [Azerbaijan]

This is my fate: I had everything, we were a happy family, and now, at 25,
I've become a widow, I'm left to raise my three children alone; the third, not
yet two months old, was born in Yerevan. Igor and I had thought that if it was 
a girl we would call her Raisa, after my mother-in-law, and if it was a boy, 
we'd call him Arsen, after Igor's grandfather. I had a girl, and I, without
Igor, named her Raisa, in honor of her dead grandmother.

Our family and the Melkumians had been neighbors since 1965. Igor and I grew 
up together, we were friends from childhood on. We got engaged when I was 16. 
In 1981, when I was 18, we were married. Two children were born to us in 
Sumgait. My daughter is now 6 years old, her name is Kristina, and my son,
Seryozha, is four and a half.

First I shall tell what happened on February 27. That day on my way home from 
work I passed Lenin Square, where about 1,500 people had gathered. There were 
Komsomol members there, and Pioneers [Children's organization], and there were 
both Party members and non-Party people there as well. All of them were 
shouting, ""There's no room for Christians here!"" and ""When we finish with the 
Armenians, we'll go after the Russians!"" And some even cried Out, ""Death to 
the Armenians!"" Absurd rumors had been circulating about town. I became 
frightened. I came home, breathless, and told about everything I had seen 
downtown. My family couldn't believe it. My father-in-law Sogomon Markovich 
Melkumian, wasn't home, he was at an Azerbaijani wedding. By eight o'clock he 
returned and had barely finished parking the car when his rear window was 
smashed with a rock. He got out of the car but there was no one there. Well I 
was telling him everything, too, and he said, ""What, is there no longer any
government?"" That same day Igor said, ""Papa, something terrible is happening 
in the city."" And he said, ""We'll stay at home, no one will drive us from our 
own home.""

The day passed. On February 28, that was Sunday, we didn't go out. We called 
our relatives and asked them all kinds of questions, and they all said the 
same thing. Sometime around evening they started smashing the car of an 
Armenian from the neighboring building. Ira, my brother-in-law's wife, and I 
called the police: they're wrecking a car, help. We called and called, and 
nonetheless they didn't come and they didn't do anything.

On February 29, on Monday, even though there were troops in the city, we were 
afraid to go to work. I called the school: I had the keys to the classroom. I 
told the senior teacher that he should send someone for the keys, I wouldn't 
be coming in. He agreed, and even said, ""Fine, don't come in, we understand 
what's going on in town, don't come in.""

Before that, on the 28th, the Ambartsumian family came over. They came to my 
father-in-law and said, ""Uncle Sergey, they broke our windows, bad things are 
happening in town."" Uncle Misha Ambartsumian even said, ""With my own eyes I 
saw them chasing naked girls through the streets. I don't know,"" he said, ""we 
should leave town."" Well on the 29th we were already trying to decide where we 
should go, thinking we'd go to our dacha. We got a couple of bags together, 
clothes, food, the bare essentials. And then somewhere around 4:45 the 
building manager came by and said, ""Uncle Sergey, the situation in town is 
bad, don't go out."" My father even opened up to him and said, ""Maybe we'll 
drive to the dacha, it'll be safer there."" ""No,"" he said, ""it'll be worse 
there, you'll be safer at home."" He said don't be afraid, if something happens 
I'll send people to save you.

After he left about 15 minutes passed and about 200 people burst into our 
courtyard. All of us were at home at the time: Igor and I and our two 
children, Ira and Edik and their daughter, my sister-in-law Ira, and my 
mother-and father-in-law. And the Ambartsumian family, there were three of 
them, Uncle Misha, Zhasmen, and their daughter Marina. Now when they started
breaking down the door I remember Edik and Igor told us, ""Go in that room
and close the door. Close the door and calm the children so they won't hear
that there's anyone home."" The children started crying. Suddenly Ira, my 
brother-in-law's wife, suggested, ""Let's run out onto the balcony."" We -- the
two daughters-in-law and the children, and Zhasmen and Marina -- raced out
onto the balcony. My sister-in-law and my mother-in-law ran in and said, 
""Quick, over to the other balcony, or they'll kill you all."" We lived on the
second floor. We needed to cross over from our balcony to our neighbor's. At
first we couldn't manage it. The balcony looked onto the street. At that time
people were coming home from work, and many just stood there, watching. I 
pleaded and begged: ""Please, call someone, have someone come!"" I even started 
shouting. ""I'll throw down the children, I'll throw them down, you catch them 
and take them somewhere, so at least the children will survive."" Either they 
were afraid or . . . I don't know what. They looked as though they were 
watching a movie. Some of them started throwing stones at us. I'll say it 
again, these weren't the bandits, these were people from the other part of the 
building and from our entryway, they were just regular people, passersby. A 
bus even stopped. I remember a man's voice saying the Armenians were climbing
over to the other balcony. Ira, my sister-in-law, helped us get the children 
over there. I was pregnant, about seven months pregnant. No, it wasn't yet 
seven, it was six and a half. I climbed over too. I think Zhasmen went first; 
you know, I just don't remember it all that well. Zhasmen went first, I think, 
and Edik's wife Ira and I had the children, and they were all screaming and 
crying. My Kristina said, ""Mamma, don't throw us over the balcony, we're 
afraid!"" Lilia was crying, and Kristina and Seryozha were crying too. Kristina 
didn't even want to climb over. She shouted, ""I'm staying with Grandmother,
I'm staying with Grandma!"" She loved her grandma, more than she loved me. And 
my mother-in-law shouted, ""Oh no, Kristina's still there, she's still there, 
save Kristina, too!"" Ira helped us climb over, with Kristina coming last. Ira 
helped us and went back inside.

We started pounding on the neighbor's balcony door. I pounded with my fist, 
Sevil, open the door, open it, please!"" She didn't open it. ""No, go away, go 
anywhere, go, I'm not opening the door."" She was our neighbor, we were 
friends, we never refused her anything, ever! And apparently she thought we 
were going to break the windows, and she opened the door. She opened it and 
said, ""Karina, Karina, go away, go anywhere, just don't stay here, they'll 
kill us, too, because of you."" I begged, ""Please, at least take the children, 
we'll leave, we'll go back."" ""No,"" she said, ""you have to leave."" Her sons ran 
in, one had a knife. Sevil's brother, he's around 18, shouted at us: ""Get out 
of here, leave, I'll kill you with this knife!"" I became terrified, I took the 
children and went out in the entryway and went down a few stairs. I went down 
and heard a loudspeaker. It was in the courtyard ""The Armenians must be 
killed, they've taken all the best places, all the best apartments!"" One of 
them said, ""Let the Armenian blood flow, none of them should survive!"" When I 
heard that I went upstairs and started knocking on doors. No one opened their 
door for me! Not on the third floor, or the fourth. I couldn't see Zhasmen any 
longer. Ira came upstairs later. I even thought that they had let her stay, 
that they would save her.

My head was spinning. They were killing my family, and here I was in the next 
entryway with two children. Seryozha was four, and Kristina was five and a 
half. They were crying, ""Mamma, we're scared!"" They were so frightened that I 
didn't even know how to calm them, should I try to calm them or myself? It was 
awful. But on the third floor a man did open his door. I asked, ""Open up, let 
me inside!"" He opened the door slightly and said, ""No!"" ""No"" and that was it! 
He said it so sternly: ""No!"" I went up to the fifth floor. I pounded my fists 
on the door with all my might. He opened up, the man of the house, and stood 
there, looking at me. I was ready to get down on my knees. I almost did get 
down on my knees. ""Please, I beg of you, at least take the children."" He 
wasn't an Azerbaijani, he was a Lezgin. I don't even know how, but he let me 
inside. And when I went in, Zhasmen was already there. Two minutes hadn't 
passed when Ira and Lilia came up the stairs. Lilia was crying. He didn't want 
to open the door. And again I started pleading, ""Please, open the door, it's 
our Ira and Lilia! Open the door!"" And he said, ""No, I'm afraid."" I said again 
and again, ""Please, open the door, please!"" He looked at me. He looked at me 
for a long time and then opened the door after all. Ira came in with Lilia. We 
threw ourselves into each other's arms, crying. Then the man locked us into 
the bathroom. We sat there for a long time. Through the door he told us, ""Calm 
the children, and calm yourselves down, too.""

Calm down? This man was hiding us, but what of our family? When I was still in 
our apartment I had sensed that none of us would come out of this alive. I 
said, ""Igor, Edik, let's say farewell."" And Edik turned around and looked at 
me as if to say, is that some kind of joke? All the same I thought they would 
kill all of us. Igor looked at me, too . . . But it was already too late! They 
started pounding on the door, Igor was standing next to the door. Before that 
he had told us, ""Go lock yourselves in that room and sit tight."" He thought we 
were in the room. But before we went out onto the balcony we went to them: 
""Edik, Igor, let's say farewell."" Igor didn't think we could climb over to the 
other balcony. And we did get over there, and I myself can't believe we were 
able to save ourselves.

Igor put on a helmet, and Edik had his coat on, and he put on a fur hat. All 
the men--Igor, Edik, their father, and Misha Ambartsumian--they all stood next 
to the door. They thought they would pound on it a while and leave. But from 
the other side of the door they ordered in Azerbaijani: ""Open the door!"" We 
were all silent, waiting. Someone outside the door said, ""They're home,
they're in there, break down the door!"" And I remember my father-in-law 
whispering, ""They're going to break it down now, it's coming down now . . . ""

He had something in his hands, I think it was a knife: if they got in, we were 
going to defend ourselves. In the hall near the door there were two metal 
chair legs. From outside the door they said, ""We're counting to five, open 
up!"" But we were all quiet, we didn't answer them. We made like no one was 
home. We figured they'd leave, they'd get tired and leave. My father-in-law 
had said, ""It's not possible they'd come into my home. How can that be? 
Everyone knows us, all of Sumgait knows our family, we are on good terms with 
everyone."" And indeed a day did not pass that there wasn't an Azerbaijani 
guest at our table. We had a nice dacha, everyone would get together there 
often, Azerbaijanis liked being with us there too. But now we had to save 
ourselves, we had to flee from our own home. Ira, I remember, said, ""I'm not 
leaving here, my brothers and my parents are here, I'm going to fight 
alongside them."" That's just what she said. She picked up a knife and said, 
""If they open the door and come into the apartment then I'm going to fight 
alongside my family, I'm not going anywhere.""

We were at Sevil's when they broke into our apartment. We heard fighting and 
shouting. The noise was terrible. And when we hid upstairs on the fifth floor 
at the Lezgin's apartment, you could hear everything up there, too. Even Ira's 
voice. I remember her calling her mother several times. She called her for a 
long time . . . I started pounding on the door in the bathroom: ""Open the 
door, what are they doing to Ira, who's shouting, that's Ira shouting, that's 
her voice!"" But the Lezgin said, ""It's nothing, calm down, no, it's not in 
your apartment."" He was lying to me so I'd calm down. Two hours went by and 
the Lezgin opened the door and said, ""Karina, Igor got away, calm down. He ran 
away."" He saw Igor break away and run off with his own eyes. They killed him 
outside, next to the building.

While we were in the bathroom I experienced every possible human terror. The 
way Ira shouted! She shouted, ""Save me, Mamma, save me! . . . Mamma, Mamma!"" 
She repeated it several times. There was a wild din. There were very many 
people there, all of them shouting, all of them bellowing, howling, 
whistling--you just can't imagine what was going on, what the roar was like.

Apparently, after they had killed Ira those murderers came into the entryway 
where we were hiding and came upstairs, all the way up to the fifth floor. I 
don't know if they were just looking for any Armenians or for us in
particular, but I think they were looking for us because when we had climbed 
over the balconies someone on the street was saying that the daughters-in-law 
were climbing over the balconies. And after we heard Ira we heard them coming 
up the stairs in the entryway and hammering on the doors. I thought those were 
our last moments, and started saying good-bye to my children, kissing them. 
They were sleeping. I woke them up: ""Kristina! Seryozha, wake up!"" And I tell 
Ira: ""Ira, if something happens, we'll throw ourselves off the balcony."" We 
were on the fifth floor. Apparently our Lezgin neighbor had opened the door 
too, because later he said, ""I opened the door and told them there were no 
Armenians inside."" And after they all left our neighbor went out on the 
balcony himself to see: they were gone.

We weren't friends with those Lezgin neighbors, we only knew each other from 
the building. But the people we were friends with wouldn't even consider 
hiding us.

The Lezgin let us out of the bathroom. They had a candle burning. He said, 
""Karina, there're no lights on in our block."" The whole block was dark, the 
whole block! It's a huge block, too. The Lezgin said, ""I'm afraid to keep
you until morning, I'm afraid of the neighbors, they might kill me for saving
you."" I said, ""What are you saying, we'll leave now. But we can't just leave
with the children in the middle of the night. Give us time to find somewhere
else to hide."" He said, ""Well OK, go look."" I asked Ira, ""Ira, do you want to
go?"" Ira said, ""No, I'll stay with the children, Karina."" I said, ""Fine, then
I'll go."" Zhasmen and I went downstairs together. It was very dark. No one 
was in the courtyard. It was dark, pitch black. l was afraid to go out at 
after seven, Igor always met me after work and accompanied me home, I never 
went out alone. And now here I was out in the middle of the night and after a
slaughter like that, too. It was probably after eleven. Later I called the 
boarding school and my director answered. He said, ""Karina, where are you?"" I
didn't know, I was calling from a public phone outside and didn't know where I 
was. I got confused and hung up the receiver. From him I only found out what 
time it was, I asked him, ""What time is it?"" He said 11:20, I think, but I 
don't really remember. So anyway Zhasmen and I went out into the courtyard. I 
look and see what appears to be a person not far from our apartment. And there
was the smell of something burnt. I became horrified. I looked at the corpse 
for a long time. It was either Ira or Edik. I only saw one of them, Zhasmen 
grabbed my hand and squeezed it: ""Hurry up, let's go . . . Hurry up, come on, 
what are you turning around for?"" I turned around and saw a large truck, it 
must have belonged to the bandits, because they came to kill us in a truck 
like that. We lived in the third entryway, and that truck was next to the 
fourth. We walked quickly, holding hands. I thought, if I go to the police 
then they'll put me away. I couldn't count on them. Before I reached the 
police station I saw a military vehicle. We went over and I said, ""Soldier, in 
Block 41, I don't know if they've killed people or injured them--we need to 
save them!"" And he said, ""Go to the police station and tell them everything."" 
I said, ""I'm afraid to go there, I'm afraid of them."" He said, ""Don't be 
afraid.""

We went to the police and they wrote down the address, and the military 
vehicle went to our building. I didn't go with them, they left me at the 
police station. I gave the addresses of my mother and my brothers so that 
they'd rescue them, too. I didn't know where they were or what had happened to
them.

After a while they brought my children and Ira and Lilia. First they took us 
to the KGB, that was at two or three in the morning. Then around five they 
took us to the City Party Committee, and there were very many people there, 
very many. I was pregnant and was wearing nothing but a dress. Seryozha was 
only wearing a shirt, and Kristina had a little dress on. No coat, no boots, 
nothing! And we sat there for three whole days in the City Party Committee.

The Lezgin had told me that Igor escaped. And I thought that he was probably 
alive. But then after two and a half days, they took us, the Armenians of 
Sumgait, to Nasosny. On March 6 some people from the Central Committee came 
and told us, ""Karina, Ira, we need you, come with us to the City Party 
Committee."" My Mamma had come to Nasosny, and she had been looking for me for 
six days. Mama, my brothers, and my uncle. We went to the City Party Committee 
and waited there in the courtyard. I was wearing nothing but a dress, and Ira 
had only a dress on as well. There was a strong wind on March 6. An hour went 
by. And then one of the functionaries told us, ""Karina, Ira, gather your 
courage. Would you like to go to the burial?"" I said, ""What, did they really 
kill all of them?!"" He said, ""Let's look."" He had a long list, and he started 
reading them off: Igor Melkumian, my husband, Eduard Melkumian, my brother-in-
law, Irina Melkumian, my sister-in-law, Sogomon Melkumian, my father-in-law,
and Raisa Melkumian, my mother-in-law. He read off all their names and said, 
""Get in the car, let's go to the burial.""

We buried our family. I couldn't believe it at the time, I couldn't conceive
of it or imagine it . . . And even now I think how shall I explain it to my 
children when they're older?

My children were very attached to their father and their grandfather and
grandmother. Kristina didn't love me the way she loved her grandfather and
grandmother, they spoiled her. Kristina would always announce, ""My grandma is 
better than anyone!"" Now, even though she is getting used to my mother, it's 
difficult for her, and once she told her: ""You're a bad grandmother.""

I don't know why, I asked her, ""Kristina, where's Papa?"" and she said, ""They 
killed him."" She knows, she understands it all. And recently I scolded
Seryozha severely for something, and he started shouting at me, ""When Papa 
comes I'm going to tell him everything!""

30. ""Let us not today fling accusations at the [Palestinian 
Arab] murderers. Who are we that we should argue 
against their hatred ? For eight years now they sit in 
their refugee camps in Gaza, and before their very eyes, 
we turn into our homestead the land and the villages in 
which they and their forefathers have lived. We are a 
generation of settlers, and without the steel helmet and 
the cannon we cannot plant a tree and build a home. Let 
us not shrink back when we see the hatred fermenting 
and filling the lives of hundreds of thousands of Arabs, 
who sit all around us. Let us not avert our gaze, so that 
our hand shall not slip. This is the fate of our generation, 
the choice of our life - to be prepared and armed, strong 
and tough - or otherwise, the sword will slip from our 
first, and our life will be snuffed out.""
(Moshe Dayan, eulogy of Roy Rutenberg at Kibbutz Nahal 
Oz, 1956, quoted in Uri Avneri, Israel without Zionists,

Ethiopian Jews and not-quite Jews

The Israeli press has published items about Ethiopian 
Jews waiting in camps in Addis Ababa for immigration to 
Israel, who are dying of starvation. The following are 
excerpts from an interview with the former general 
director of the JDC project for development and welfare 
of Ethiopian Jews, Kobi Friedman (Hadashot, 21 April 
1993), who has stated that ""there are people dying in 
Addis Ababa, but they are converts to Christianity"":

""Hadashor published the item about the dying Jews after 
viewing a video tape filmed last week in Adis Ababa. 
How do you know that they are actually converts to 
Chritianity ?

""If there are Jews on the tape, then I don't know what to 
say. I am speaking from experience when I say that those 
who remained in Ethiopia are Christians. I know that 
there have previously been things published in the press 
by interesting parties, and there is no connection 
between them and reality.""

""What interested parties ?""

""Ethiopian immigrants who want their Christian relatives 
to come here.""

""What to you recommend that Ethiopian children in Israel 
do, when their parents and the rest of their relatives 
remain in Ethiopia ?""

""I ask if it is the job of the State of Israel to bring in the 
40 relatives who stayed in Ethiopia. Well, my answer is 
that it is not. It would be a better solution, economically 
as well, for that young man to buy a one-way ticket to 
Ethiopia and reunite with his family there.""

It is not a question of an individuals standing. When a party puts up an
Arab for a Cabinet post and that Arab is rejected but the position is given
to a Jew from the same party we are not talking about power but racism.
Would you care to deny this has happened on several occasions with Labour
coalitions?

Not their party - them as *individuals*. Even when they belong to nice
peaceful Zionist mainstream parties they are not welcome. Arabs are
excluded on ficitious security grounds which are just an excuse. It
sure looks like racism to me.

Arabs are excluded from cabinet, even when they do the things you
suggest, because they are Arabs. Unless of course you have a better
reason? I am happy to listen to any good reason why a leftist Jew
is less of a security risk than a leftist Arab from the same party.
Look at the present cabinet.

Well, does it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920, 
the Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted and participated 
in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race, religion
and national origin?

1) Armenians did slaughter the entire Muslim population of Van.[1,2,3,4,5]
2) Armenians did slaughter 42% of Muslim population of Bitlis.[1,2,3,4]
3) Armenians did slaughter 31% of Muslim population of Erzurum.[1,2,3,4]
4) Armenians did slaughter 26% of Muslim population of Diyarbakir.[1,2,3,4]
5) Armenians did slaughter 16% of Muslim population of Mamuretulaziz.[1,2,3,4]
6) Armenians did slaughter 15% of Muslim population of Sivas.[1,2,3,4]
7) Armenians did slaughter the entire Muslim population of the x-Soviet
   Armenia.[1,2,3,4]

'Alone'? Sorry, but the following western scholars are forced to disagree 
with you. During the First World War and the ensuing years - 1914-1920, 
the Armenians through a premeditated and systematic genocide, 
tried to complete its centuries-old policy of annihilation against 
the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 2.5 million Muslims and 
deporting the rest from their 1,000 year homeland.

The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance

	Not necessarily.  As Shai points out, political appointments are
based on power.  They are also based on favors owed, coalition
building, and deal making.  While this may have a racist element to
it, I think that its much more fair to attribute it to the ""old boy""
nature of politics.  Now, I'll freely admit that the old boy system
has racist and sexist effects, but I don't think that those are its
purpose, whether in the US, Israel, or elsewhere.

	Here again, you miss out on the old boy nature of politics,
and the existance of back-room deals.  As individuals, these arabs may
not be as well connected as the Jew who gets the job.  I don't like
this aspect of politics, but I understand it exists.

   It is your responsibility for posting quotes in context.  Your
   phony 'research center' is the source of the most unscholarly,
   out-of-context, agenda-ridden, and sophmoric propaganda that I
   have ever seen.  Don't believe me, folks?  Let's take a little
   stroll through a few of Elias Davidsson's contributions to our 
   understanding of the middle east.
 
ED> Quotations from Zionist leaders

ED> 1. ""There was no such thing as Palestinians""
ED> (Golda Meir, Prime Minister of Israel, London Sunday 
ED> Times, 15 June 1969)

    And what do suggest that she meant by this?  Do you think she
    meant that the Palestinians don't exist?  Or does it actually
    mean that the people who self-identify as 'Palestinians,' did
    not appear to be a distinct ethnic group in the eyes of Golda
    Meir?  


ED> 2. ""There is, however, a difficulty from which the Zionist 
ED> dares not avert his eyes, though he rarely likes to face it. 
ED> Palestine proper has already its inhabitants.""
ED> (Israel Zangwill, The Voice of Jerusalem, London 1920, 
ED> p.88)

    When this was written, seventy three years ago, the people of
    the region were not all Jews.  They are not all Jews now.  No
    Jew but the most rabid bigot has ever called for an Israel to
    be ONLY for Jews.  That was true then.  It is true now.  


ED> ""[The Palestinians are] beasts walking on two legs.""
ED> (Menachem Begin, Prime Minister of Israel in a speech to 
ED> the Knesset,
ED> quoted in Amnon Kapeliouk, 'Begin and the ""Beasts"", New 
ED> Statesman, 25 June 1982)

    Since you inserted the words 'The Palestinians are' we cannot
    know what Begin was talking about.  
    
    For someone who wants to embellish his own importance with an 
    absurd pseudo-organizational name like the 'Center for Policy
    Research,' you are not a very honest person. 


ED> ""Both the process of expropriation [of the Palestinians] 
ED> and the removal of the poor must be carried out 
ED> discreetly and circumspectly"".
ED> (Dr. Theodor Herzl, The Complete Diaries, Herzl Press, 
ED> 1960, I., p.88)

    Herzl died eighty nine years ago.  Are you suggesting that he
    has stated what is Israel's policy today?  Have you ever seen
    Israel even entertain a policy to exclude non-Jews, let alone  
    actually try to remove non-Jews from Israel?  If you actually 
    believe that this quote has anything to do with Israel's non-
    Jewish citizenry today, you are an idiot.  But if you realize
    that Israel has no intention of removing non-Jewish Israelis,
    then you are nothing but a common liar.  This one time I will 
    give you the benefit of the doubt, and assume you are stupid. 

 
ED> ""We shall try to spirit the penniless population [the 
ED> Palestinians] across the border by procuring employment 
ED> for it in the transit countries, while denying it any 
ED> employment in our own country""
ED> (Theodor Herzl, The Complete Diaries, Herzl Press, 1960, 
ED> I, p.88)

    Once again you quote a man gone for almost a century.  You do
    so within the context of modern day Israel.  
    
    Thomas Jefferson owned slaves.  How does this fact define the
    United States today?


ED> ""[Jews] must expel Arabs and take their place"" 
ED> (David Ben Gurion, 1937, quoted in Shabtai Teveth, Ben 
ED> Gurion and the Palestine Arabs, Oxford University Press, 
ED> 1985, p. 89)

    Did he say 'Jews,' or did you add this?
 
    This was also a statement from ten years before Israel became
    a state.  It has no bearing on Israel.  
    

ED> ""We must do everything to ensure they [the 
ED> Palestinian refugees] never do return""
ED> (David Ben Gurion, in his diary, 19 July 1948, quoted in 
ED> Michael Bar Zohar, Ben Gurion: The Armed Prophet, 
ED> Prentice-Hall, 1967, p.157)

    YOU added the words 'the Palestinian refugees.'  And by doing
    so, you are misleading people into believing that Ben Gurion,
    who was expressing his hope that people who fled their lands,
    at the encouragement of people such as KING ABDULLAH, and the  
    MUFTI OF JERUSALEM, was gloating over people abandoning their
    homes.  What he was refering to were the Arabs with whom Jews
    were at war.  

ED> ""The country was mostly an empty desert, with only 
ED> a few islands of Arab settlement""
ED> (Shimon Peres, Minister of Defense, quoted in David's 
ED> Sling: The Arming of Israel, Weidenfeld and Nicholson, 
ED> 1970, p.249)

    At the time of the rebirth of Israel this was certainly true,
    especially when compared to what Israel has accomplished in a
    few short decades.


ED> ""All this story about the danger of extermination [of 
ED> Jews] has been blown up....to justify the annexation of 
ED> new Arab territories""
ED> (Mordechai Bentov, Israeli Cabinet Minister, Al 
ED> Hamishmar, 14 April 1972)

    Since Israel has not annexed even one millimeter of territory 
    in more twenty six years, this quote is irrelevant. 


ED> ""Neither Jewish ethics nor Jewish tradition can 
ED> disqualify terrorism as a means of combat""
ED> (Yitzhak Shamir, Hehazit, Summer 1943 [Journal of the 
ED> LEHI, the Stern Gang], translated from the Israeli daily 
ED> Al-Hamishmar, 24 December 1987

    Again, you are quoting a man who was fighting for what he had
    been promised from a time as ancient as biblical, to the time
    of the Balfour Declaration, just a few short years back.  And
    what was thought of and described as terrorism by Jews didn't
    include slaughtering Olympic athletes, brutally murdering the 
    innocent, attacking school buses, and murdering another human 
    being for the sole reason that he or she is an Arab.
 
 
ED> ""The domination of Jewish agriculture by Arab 
ED> workers is a cancer in our body""
ED> (A. Uzan, Israeli Minister of Agriculture, Ha'aretz, 13 
ED> December 1974)

    There were serious concerns about a work force that consisted 
    of people from OUTSIDE Israel.  It is a wise to be concerned.
    A work force consisting of foreigners is not a good situation
    for a country.


ED> ""There can be only one national home in Palestine, 
ED> and that a Jewish one, and no equality in the partnership 
ED> between Jews and Arabs""
ED> (Montague David Eder, President of the Zionist 
ED> Federation of Great Britain, 1931,
ED> in Doreen Ingrams, comp., Palestine Papers 1917-1922, 
ED> Seeds of Conflict, George Braziller, 1973, p. 135)

    This also has no meaning for a country formed seventeen years
    after this statement was made.  Obviously times change.  This
    is NOT what Israel is about today.  I believe the peace talks
    make this quote irrelevant.


ED> ""There is not a single Jewish village in this country 
ED> that has not been built on the site of an Arab village""
ED> (Moshe Dayan, Ha'aretz, 4 April 1969...)

    This is completely false.


ED> ""Some people talk of expelling 700,000 to 800,000 
ED> Arabs in the event of a new war, and instruments have 
ED> been prepared""
ED> (Aharon Yariv, former chief of Israeli military 
ED> intelligence, 1980, Inquiry, 8 December 1980)

    Expelled from where?  Israel?  The occupied territories?  New
    Jersey?  Is there any way we can read this and get an idea as
    to what on earth he was talking about.  Obviously not.

 
ED> ""We should there [in Palestine] form a portion of the 
ED> rampart of Europe against Asia, an outpost of civilization 
ED> as opposed to barbarism.""
ED> (Dr. Theodor Herzl, The Jewish State, London, 1896, p. 
ED> 29)

    Interesting notion.  Considering that this was written nearly
    a century ago, it is quite visionary.


ED> ""I deeply believe in launching preventive war 
ED> against the Arab States without further hesitation. By 
ED> doing so we will achieve two targets: firstly, the 
ED> annihilation of Arab power; and secondly, the expansion 
ED> of our territory""
ED> (Menachem Begin, in a speech to the Knesset, 12 October 
ED> 1955)

    This was said nearly forty years ago.  Begin is dead.  And it
    should be obvious to anybody that if Israel was expansionist,
    it would have ANNEXED the occupied territories right after it
    captured them.  Israel would not be negotiating to get rid of
    them.


ED> ""During the last 100 years our people have been in a 
ED> process of building up the country and the nation, of 
ED> expansion, of getting additional Jews and additional 
ED> settlements in order to expand the borders here. Let no 
ED> Jew say that the process has ended. Let no Jew say that 
ED> we are near the end of the road.""
ED> (Moshe Dayan, Ma'ariv, 7 July 1968)

    He's dead, too.  And since Israel has not annexed ANY land at 
    all since 1967, you are once again wasting bandwidth with all
    of these misleading quotes.  They are so out of sync with the
    reality of Israel, that you do nothing but make yourself look
    like a fanatic desperate to sway people, by misleading them.


ED> ""Let us not today fling accusations at the [Palestinian 
ED> Arab] murderers. Who are we that we should argue

ED> the choice of our life - to be prepared and armed, strong

ED> (Moshe Dayan, eulogy of Roy Rutenberg at Kibbutz Nahal 
ED> Oz, 1956, quoted in Uri Avneri, Israel without Zionists, 
Collier Books, Macmillan, New York, 1971, p.154)

    Interesting quote.  It's true that we should never lose sight
    of the plight of these people.  We should also recognize that
    this quote preceded the disgusting wave of Arab terrorism and
    violence directed at innocent people, that began in 1972 with 
    the massacre of the Israeli athletes in Munich, and continues 
    to this day.

    If your ability to obscure was the equal of your desire to do
    so, truthseekers in this group would have a problem.  But you
    are an easily recognized fanatic, whose stream of misleading,
    partial, and out-of-context quotes are totally  unfettered by
    the burden of truth.

Actually, just after the FIRST world war, many Muslims were killed by Serbs.
Under Serbian-led regime between the two world wars, many Croats were
also killed (especially during the dictatorship introduced on Jan. 6, 1929).
Some Croats formed a resistance movement ""Ustashas"" (Insurgents) and
were forced into exile, to fascist Italy, which sheltered them.  In exile,
they practiced a terrorist approach to liberating Croatia; while Croats in
Croatia followed the approach of peaceful negotiations under the leadership
of Vladko Macek.  After the Axis powers took control in the SECOND world
war, Vladko Macek refused to collaborate, so Ustashas were brought in 
to run the newly formed puppet state.  This state included both Croatia and
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and its ideology saw Muslims as the best Croats
(""flowers of Croatian people"").  Some Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina
therefore joined Ustashas.  However, even more others did not; they
joined Tito's Partisans.    The Ustashas membership peaked at 
less than 1% of Croat and Muslim population of that area at that time.

After WWII, Muslims were still considered a religious minority descended
from Croats or Serbs who converted to Islam centuries ago.  But, in 1968,
it was decided that forcing Muslims to declare their nationality as
either Serbs or Croats is not a good policy.  Dobrica Cosic, the current
president of the rump Yugoslavia, was strongly opposed, and sought to
prevent the category ""Muslim"" (in an ethnic sense) from appearing on the
next census.  He was criticized and expelled from the party.  So, since
that time, Bosnian Muslims are considered a separate nationality, although
some still deny this and insist that they choose either Serb or Croat
nationality.

Sincerely,
Josip

Look nobody asked those countries about their UN forces
to be on the ground.  They can take their forces which are
incomponent and ineffective at the first place.  And let whoever are
willing to do the job what it takes.  How anyone can defend this
stinking UN force on the ground who let the Bosnnian PM
yanked out from the UN vehicle and being shot by the Serbian
military?  How anyone can defend this UN force who are just watching
the shelling on cities and towns everyday?  How anyone can
defend and say those stinking UN forces being effective
when Bosnian had almost 14,000 children casualties between 5-14 age 
groups?  I think talking about the current UN forces to Bosnian
muslims is just an insult to their casualties.   

I think Senator Biden said it all what has to be said on this issue.
Europe is a sad place to criticize human rights in anywhere in this 
world.  Like Biden said, they are the bigots when it comes to 
cultural difference and minorty closer to their home.
Because they get rid of their minorities long long time
ago starting in 15th centuries.  And they let Adolph
to take care of the rest in 20th Century.  But he was much more 
naughty than they expected because he dared to step many 
toes.  So, why spoil the good thing now when Serbs doing today what 
they were thinking the same yesterday.

Actually I am not sure you have understood what I have said. On several
occasions a minor party has put up an Arab for a Cabinet position. That
is the major party (Labour in this case) has agreed that a minor party
can have so many seats and that party nominates an Arab for one. This is
not acceptable to the major party which insists on the minor party
appointing a Jew. The favours owed, deals done, have all been settled.
What remains is exactly who is going to sit in Cabinet. The party that
gets the seat wants an Arab but that is not acceptable. This *is* racism.
It has nothing to do with politics at all.

Macedonia said yesterday it had neither requested or needs such

This is sort of like sending the National Guard to Bel Air when

Obviously, Clinton is again trying to make policy for image purposes

assume a share of responsibility for the problem.  He obviously
didn't even consult with the Macedonians...he was just looking at

have troops on the ground in the former Yugoslavia too...now let
me bomb so I can make it look like I am doing something in the
American media. 

The problem is that the blue berets in Bosnia are dead meat if
Clinton starts bombing, but Clinton doesn't have the courage to
ask that the blue berets leave, because then he becomes primarily
responsible to the Bosnian policy of the UN and the allies.
Clinton wants to have his cake and eat it too...he wants to feel
free to use American military power for the sake of domestic
US politics and his domestic image, but he doesn't want to assume
the primary international leadership role in the UN and among

because with leadership comes responsibility, and Clinton seems

   It is indeed different usage of the word Muslim . In Bosnia , it is more or
less used as an ethnic term not as religious one . There are people in Bosnia
who refer to themselves as ""Christian Bosnian Muslims"" if you can make sense
of that . Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Muslims have the same language. 
Bosnian Muslims are mainly beleivers of Islam. I got this from Bosnian Muslim
friend of mine who goes to University of Texas in Austin.

Actually, the record of the Allies activities, in the face of
incontrovertible evidence as to what the Nazis (may they rot in hell)
were doing, clearly points to the conclusion that they would have done
nothing.  The railways to the camps were not bombed, despite the ease
of doing so.  The US, the ""place of refuge"" allowed in a bare pittance
of Jews from Europe, primarily for public relations, so that the
government could say it was ""doing something"".  Many ships with
refugees were turned away from US shores; some found refuge in Cuba or
South America, many others sunk or had to return to Europe (with
predictable consequences).  The hope today is that we have
collectively learned a lesson, and are less complacent to ignore other
countries' ""internal affairs"".  The sad reality is that this does not
seem to be the case.

This is one of the most ridiculous arguments I have heard from the 
Europeans. ""Let's let the Serbs massacre, rape, and ethnically clean
100,000 Bosnians because we don't want our pretty blue berets there
to get scratched"".  Well, I say, get them the hell out of there if you're
worried for them, but don't deny Bosnians their basic right to self
defense! Lift the embargo against Bosnia, and let them defend themselves.
What makes the UN troops more valuable than the Bosnian people?  They
are letting the civilians die so the soldiers could survive, when
if anything, it should be the other way around.  Idiots like Owen 
expect Bosnians to swallow a forced plan, and just hope this problem
will go away.  Well they're wrong.  If they had got their butts in gear
(that is, if Bosnia had oil) a year ago, much of this could be prevented.
Now, however, the results of this tragedy will last for generations.
That's like forcing the jews to make peace with Hitler. Yeah right.
This, as senator Biden said, reeks of bigotry, and makes me and any 
decent human being for that matter, quite sick.  It should be the
Europeans, not the Americans, who take the inititiative and ask the
other for support.  This is their backyard, not the Americans.
Today it's Bosnia, tomorrow it will be Kosovo and Macedonia, Greece,
and then Turkey, and the damn thing will spread.  Not to mention 
European muslims who weren't even practicing before will rally to
fundamentalism. Good luck handling that, your majesty!  Owen was
upset at the question which compared him to Chamberlain, who hoped
to appease Hitler.  He said that Chamberlain had been in Munich 2 years
before any war, I have been here during a blazing war for the last
18 months.  Well, that makes him even worse, because Chamberlain could
have at least argued I'm giving Germany the benefit of the doubt,
whereas Owen can't even do that.  What the west is doing is aiding the
Serbs by tying the Bosnians' hands, and making the stupid excuse of their
powerless troops on the ground, who can't even protect the Bosnian foreign
minister in their own armored vehicle, and watch the killers just walk
away!  What kind of peace is this?  What kind of civilization is this?

European leaders are PATHETIC, and are helping a genocide which even they
will not be able to forget.  Yeah, they'll go to Africa and fight for some
damn dictator in their former colony, they'll go to Kuwait and fight for
oil, but in Bosnia not only they won't fight aggression, they'll even
tie the hands of the victim.  Now you tell me who is fooling whom.

You've asked a crucial question that underlies much of the genocide. 
Bosnian Muslims are slavic in ethnicity. They speak Serbo-Croatian. But
there is a Christo-Slavic ideology whereby all true slavs are Christian
and anyone who converted to Islam thereby must have changed ethnicity by
changing religion.  See the poems of Ngegos or the novels of Ivo Andric
who brilliantly displays these attitudes on the part of what he calls
""the people"" (i.e. Christian slavs).  For this reason, the war-criminals
call all the Bosnian Muslims ""Turks"" even though they are not ethnically
Turk and do not speak Turkish as their first language.  For this reason,
what is actually a genocide labeled against those who are ethnically
identical but religiously ""other"" is called, paradoxically, ""ethnic
cleansing"" rather than ""religious cleansing.""

Thus, while a war rages between Serbs and Croats as a continuation of
WWII, and older agenda, the annihilation of Islam and Muslims from
Bosnian, is being carried out under the cover of the Serbo-Croat war.

Mike.

I really don't know how you can possibly maintain this hypocritical
stance.

On the one hand, you imply that there is a conspiracy of Arab-Americans
that warrants the illegal gathering of information on them (ie. auto license/
registration information in California) and other forms of ""monitoring"", including
blatant attempts by paid ADL agents to discredit an American-Arab 
organization by trying to distribute Nazi propaganda.  Furthermore,
you attempt to rationalize this through crude stereotyping by pointing 
to the WTC bombing, in which Arab-Americans had no involvement.

On the other hand, you publish this excerpt, which seems to rail
against notions of a racial (Jewish, in this case) conspiracy and
stereotypes.

If you really aren't the hypocrite you appear to be, please explain 
yourself.

""Muslim"" in ex-Yugoslavia was a *nation* not a religion.  In fact, not
all Muslims in B-H are followers of Islam.  Therefore, there do (did?)
exist in ex-Yugoslavia ""Christian Muslims.""  Tito defined the Muslim 
nation constitutionally, adding Muslims to Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes,
the three founding nations which entered into a voluntary union at the
end of WWI.  In addition, Tito added two other nations constitutionally:
Montenegrins, and Makedonijans. 

Nations had the right of secession, but republics did not.  So, ""Muslim""
is much more a political term than a religious term (for those who

chose to fight over the terms of secession instead of compromising and

    I too noticed that in all this screaming and shouting, not one 
person brought up the question of atrocities being commited on non-muslims 
by the Sudanese Government. Could it be that they are Africans and so who
cares? I suggest that everyone cut the hypocrisy and bleating about Bosnia 
and go on to discuss something even more meaningless.

    The report below shows that the Sudanese are acting in the finest
traditions of Islamic law as expounded by some die-hard people on the 
net (who shall remain nameless). 

Sudan
-----

Government troops 'steal women, children'


WASHINGTON - Government troops in Sudan are involved in massacres,
kidnapping and the transporting of forced labor into Libya, according
to a State Department document declassified Wednesday.

    The report compiled by the U.S. embassy in Khartoum said government
forces, particularly Arab militias organized as the Popular Defense
Forces, ""routinely steal women and children"" in southern Sudan.

    ""Some women and girls are kept as wives, the others are shipped
north where they perform forces labor on Kordofan (central Sudan) 
farms or are exproted, notably to Libya,"" it said.

who aren't necessarily outsiders? And while you're at it, could you

It seems that, to keep the peace talks going, Israel has to keep
making goodwill gesture after goodwill gesture, while Palestinian
Arabs continue to go around hunting Jews.

If the peace talks are going to have any realistic chance of success,
the Arabs are going to have to start reciprocating, especially since
they are the ones who will be getting tangible concessions in return
for giving up only intangibles.  If they keep trying to change the
already agreed upon rules, which seems to be one of their favorite
games, the Israelis are not likely to be very confident that the
intangibles they will receive at the bargaining table will be worth
the parchment they're written on.

It takes two to negotiate a peace.  It's time for the Arabs to start
doing their share.

In today's Jerusalem Post Magazine there is a feature story about the
ongoing restoration of synagogues in the Jewish Quarter.  The author,
Leah Abramowitz, writes that there were FIFTY-SEVEN synagogues in the
quarter in 1948, ALL of which were destroyed, some, she says, used as
donkey stables.  The building shells, that is.

I still find it really, really hard to understand why the demolition
of the buildings in front of the Kotel continues to evoke more outrage
than this.  Everything is so much cheaper when it happens to the Jews.

Why?

This does not change the *fact* that ""Muslim"" is a legal and political
term defined constitutionally in former Yugoslavia, and therefore has
meaning and consequences entirely *independent* and *immaterial* of
any religious considerations.

You only wish it were so.

More than 2,000,000 residents of Croatia and B-H have *not* accepted the
terms of secession which Tudjman and Izetbegovic unilaterally forced upon
them.  Croats and Muslims may have a right to negotiated secession but
they do not have a right to grab the *entire* territories of the former
Yugoslav republics of Croatia and B-H.

Oh, BTW, *Yugoslavia* was *internationally recognized* when it was 
destroyed by Tudjman, Izetbegovic, Milosevic, and the international
community led by Germany.  If Yugoslavia's borders could be changed
against its will, then certainly Croatia's borders and B-H's borders
can be changed as well.  

As I have stated many times: the civil war in ex-Yugoslavia will end
when the terms of secession (borders, etc.) for Croatia and B-H are
finally agreed upon.  Serbs, Croats, and Muslims will *all* have to
make territorial concessions to reach such an agreement.

It has nothing to do with how long they have been voting, as much as HOW
they have been voting.  Pick up a list of the Labor parties proposals
for MK prior to the election and pay attention to the order.  Correlate this
with the number of Arab party members eligible to vote in party elections.
Further correlate this with the voting results from Arab areas.

Lo and behold, you will discover that Israeli Arab Labor party members
did not band together unanimously or en large for a select group of
Arab candidates.  This problem is further exacerbated by the rifts
between Israeli Arabs.  Some claim membership to right wing parties
while others vote for parties that do not pass the minimum cutoff.

I worked within the labor party during the late 70's elections (not this
last one) as a volunteer and was privy to the voting results that
were returned from the local delegates elected.  At the time, the system
was structured differently but it did not cease to amaze me that there
was no massive effort to lobby for Arab reps. by their own delegates.

Quite simply, if all eligible Arab voters became members of the Labor
party and voted, they would be able to command more than %15 of
the delegates.  This is a power base that can not be ignored!
Especially when they are not ranked high in the party (once again
due to lack of political power).  I have seen how the labor party
works from the inside and my experience has been that, as in most
political situations, the MKs act out of their own self-interest.

And to answer your question, I ""broke"" with labor because I felt
that they were heeding too much to the right-wing and ultra-orthodox
coalition members.

Fair enough.  My take on the matter, and I will admit to the possibility
that this might be seen differently is that this was a dummy argument.
If he was sitting on the committee, then someone else obviously would not
be.  In drumming up support for his seat, MK [?] would not be averse to
using this argument, or it could be used on his behalf.

As to the proof presented in this article, I would find it very
interesting to know who proposed the compromise along with a followup
describing how the matter stands/was resolved.

Let me just take this opportunity to say that I deplore such actions
and groundless justifications.

Check your facts before bashing Islam again. While there may be Muslim  
anti-semites, this is no way a tenet of the religion. Saying anti-semitism is  
""basic"" to Islam is implicating the entire Muslim world, based on a selective  
sampling of a few people, and it flies in the face of what Islam teaches.

Not sure.  But the number of Israelis killed defending Israel is a little more
than 17,000 in the last 45 years and 61,000 injured.

You must try to make a mockery out of everything, don't you?  Pathetic.

     What a lie..!!??

     Ask the victims of the Nazis.
     Don't take the Bosnian muslims' word for it.
     Ask the Holoucost survivors who helped them, you will hear that
     the Bosnian muslims (among others) helped them.

     I also do object to the term ethnic cleansing, since what is happening
     in Bosnia is not ethnic cleansing, they all have the same ethnicity,
     what is different is religion. they are Orthodox christians, Catholic 
     christians, and Muslims.

     It's religious cleansing.

     Also watching people being rounded up and slaughtered by the slitting of 
     the throat, raped collectively and systematically, driven out of their
     homes by the millions (!!!!), tortured in concentration camps, maimed
     and ..... does indeed amount to moral rape.

     Nothing in the history justifies what's happening.

	First of all, this is NOT a strife; this is a massacre of innocent
	Moslem poeples by the Christian West.

	Since Ottoman lost the control of Balkans, many tens and hundereds
	of millions of Muslem peoples (Turks, Albanians, Bosnians, and others) 
	have been tortured, raped, massacred, and driven out of their homes
	by the Cristians of both the region and Europe. Some lucky ones 
	escaped to relative safety in Turkiye. The remaining others are being 
	finished now by local Christians, the USA, and the rest of Europe.

	The Christian West is maintaining a tight arms ambargo on the Muslem
	peoples of Bosnia so they cannot deffend themslves while letting 
	Christian Serbs and Croats torture, rape, and massacre the innocent 
	Moslem peoples of Bosnia.

	It took Christian Europe for almost six centuries to achieve this
	objective of theirs and I do not think they will let it up. This will 
	go on untill every single Moslem person (Bosnian, Turk, Albanian, etc)
	is tortured, raped, massacred, and driven out of their homes.

There are various contradictory views on the origin of the Armenians.
The name is to be found in the Darian inscriptions in the form 'Armina'
or 'Aramaniya' is to be found in the inscription on the Bistun monument.
The following references to the Armenians are to be found in the Bistun
cuneiform inscription of Dara Vishdasb (510 B.C.).

 1. The monarch Dara said: I sent my servant to Arminam 'Armeniya'.

 6. On reaching Arminam 'Armeniya'.

 7. To the country town of Zozo, to Armaniya 'Armeniya'.

According to Karakashian:

As for 'Armenia', the equivalent of the 'Armin' or 'Arminik' of the Persians,
this is more recent than the word 'Ararat', and is to be found used in
the Dara inscriptions for 'Haiastan'.  

Saint Martin:

The name 'Armenie' has been given since very early times by almost all
the various eastern peoples to the territory referred to by the Armenians
as 'Haiastan'. It was known to the Syrians as Armenia and to the Arabs
as Ermeniyye.
 
Others believe that Urartu was known in the time of the Medes as 'Harminap'
which was later modified by the Persians to 'Arminia'. 'Ar' refers to a
place, as in Ararat, Archish, Aruyr, Archar, Arshav, Arazen and Aror, 
while 'men' is used to refer to spirit, thought or human being, and 
therefore 'Armen' would appear to signify 'the people of that place'.

G. Alishan believes that 'according to our national vocabulary ""Haik""
is the diminutive form of ""Hai"", and that ""Hai"" is the name of our
nation. Our nation is in no way connected with the word ""Armen"" that
foreigners apply to our people.'

It would thus appear that 'Armenia' is a place-name, that 'Armen' is 
the name of the people who lived there, and that these are in no way
connected with the word 'Hai'.

Haik and Haiastan:

Armenian historians believe Haik to have been a great hero from whom
the Armenian people took the name 'Hai'. But the mere resemblance
between the words 'Haik' and 'Hai' constitutes no real proof, and,
in any case, no such theory appears before the time of Moses of
Khoren.

Haiasa:

The following studies show quite clearly that 'Hai' and 'Haiasa' were
no more than general names used by the Hittites to refer to the 
region known as Armenia.

Professor Hachadurian: 'Haiasa was the general name used in Hittite
inscriptions for Upper Armenia.'

Yensen, in his 'Hittites and Armenians' tries to prove that 'Hai' is
identical with the Hittite 'Hatio', in other words that 'Hai' is a
Hittite word. Research, however, has proved this erroneous, and shown
that 'Hai' was derived from 'Hatio'.

Mortman's attempt to read the Urartu inscriptions as Armenian met with 
no success. As for Greek, there is no point in even mentioning it.

The resemblance between the words 'Haiasa' and 'Haiastan' is so obvious
that we may well accept 'Haiasa' as the oldest form of 'Haiastan'.

Let us now cast a brief glance on how the words 'Hai', 'Haikazan' and
'Haiastan' entered our older works.

According to Karakashian: 

'The word ""Haik"" is never to be found employed with reference to a
leader of the Armenian people prior to Moses of Khoren, nor is it
ever found employed in the forms ""Haika"" or ""Haykazn"".

Agahangelos and Puzant use the word as a title or a place-name (he
improved and developed Haiastan, etc.). If the word had referred
to a nation and had been derived from ""Hai"" or ""Haik"" they could 
also have used the words ""Haikak"" and ""Haykazn"" in a number of
places.'

According to Professor Sayce, who deciphered a number of Hittite 
inscriptions:

'In the Hittite language the suffix -ha is used to specify quality
or species. The words ""Haddanas"", ""Haddina"" were used by the 
Assyrians to refer to the Hittites. With the transformation of the
""d"" between the two ""a"" letters to ""y"" ""Hadinasdani"" was in this
way transformed to ""Haiastan""'.

Professor Grechmer fully agrees with this point of view, but regards
the significance and explanation so far accorded to the terms 'Hai'
and 'Haistan' as quite unsatisfactory. He finds, however, that a 
solution to this problem is brought nearer by the name 'Haiasa' 
which is so frequently found in Bogazkoy from 1400 B.C. onwards.
Forrer takes 'Haiasa' as referring to Upper Armenia. In that case
it seems likely that 'Haiasa' was actually a part of Armenia. The
suffix -dan is of Anatolian origin. The real root is 'Hayasa', which
refers to the country of the 'Hayasas'.

E. Chantre writes as follows on the subject of the ethnological 
and Anthropological characteristics of the Armenian people.

The Armenians in Russia may be characterized as follows: Almost
all of them are brachycephalic or leptocephalic, very dark,
above average height, an Aissores Asian group with close ties
with certain Kurdish tribes and Azerbaijan peoples.

According to J. Deniker:

From the philological point of view, the Armenian and Kurds may be
regarded as belonging to the Iranian group...The Armenians are 
descended from various elements and from a very mixed race. Their
average height varies between 1.63 and 1.69 according to the region.
They are almost always short-headed, with skull measurements of 
85-87. As a race they belong to the Indo-Afghan-Assyrian-Turkic
family.

Professor Rene Vernont writes as follows:

The Armenians are a mixture of Semites, Turk, Kurds and Mongols,
but some of them display Armenian features, e.g., height a little
above average, fair complexion, dark hair, dark eyes, very often
a hooked nose and a rather wide mouth. 

Investigations carried out by N. Kossovitch on the links between
Armenian blood groups and their anthropological characteristics
led him to the conclusion that the Armenians did not form a 
distinct race.

	The honest answer to your question about Arabs who were expelled
from Jaffa, and/or who fled Jaffa, or anywhere else in Israel, having
the right to return is:  Yes, unfortunately, they have the right to
return.  They may apply for citizenship like any other non-Israeli and
then go to >Jaffa and try to buy their house back from the Jews who now
own it.  

	And now a question and answer for you:  Can the Jews who were
born and raised in Hebron, or their descendants go back to THEIR homes
in Hebron?  The answer is: absolutely NOT, because they were almost all
murdered by their Arab neighbors - the ""palestinians"".

	Now, do I think the Arabs should be allowed to even visit
""their"" homes in Jaffa?  Hell, no.  Bring back the Jews of Hebron, Petah
Tikva, Jerusalem, Safed, etc. Then, perhaps I would be in favor of Arabs
returning to their Jaffa homes.  However, seeing as no Arab has yet been
able to bring people back from the dead, I'd say that's out.

Here you descend into total inanity. Your inability to distinguish

""In April 1915 Dashnaks from Russian Armenia organized a revolt in the city 
 of Van, whose 33,789 Armenians comprised 42.3 percent of the population, 
 closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the Empire...Leaving Erivan 
 on April 28, 1915, Armenian volunteers reached Van on May 14 and organized 
 and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during 
 the next two days.""

""Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions,
 Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims.
 Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First
 World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse
 to serve their state, the Ottoman Empire, and to assist instead other
 invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian
 success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of
 Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders, army officers, and common
 soldiers began deserting in droves.""

""With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of
 World War I, the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy
 increased drastically. Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks,
 Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations, who in turn
 massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of
 expected arrival of the invading Russian armies.""

""...Meanwhile, Czar Nicholas II himself came to the Caucasus to make final
 plans for cooperation with the Armenians against the Ottomans, with the 
 president of the Armenian National Bureau in Tiflis declaring in response:

 'From all countries Armenians are hurrying to enter the ranks of the 
  glorious Russian Army, with their blood to serve the victory of Russian
  arms...Let the Russian flag wave freely over the Dardanelles and the
  Bosporus. Let, with Your will, great Majesty, the peoples remaining
  under the Turkish yoke receive freedom. Let the Armenian people of Turkey
  who have suffered for the faith of Christ receive resurrection for a new
  free life under the protection of Russia.'[155]

Armenians again flooded into the czarist armies. Preparations were made
to strike the Ottomans from the rear, and the czar returned to St. Petersburg
confident that the day finally had come for him to reach Istanbul.""

I went through this just a few weeks ago; here it comes again. The 
entire Turkish population of Armenia (which Armenians called Tartars) 
constituted at least about 40% of the total population of Armenia 
was deliberately exterminated. (For the population statistics, please 
look to the book of Richard Hovannessian, ""Armenia on the Road to 
Independence."") I listed three books earlier of such a monstrous crime 
by the writings of one Armenian, one American, and one British. They 
are: ""Men Are Like That"" by Leonard R. Hartill; ""Adventures in the Near 
East"" by A. Rawlinson; ""World Alive, A Personal Story"" by Robert Dunn. 
Also, I personally have copies of documents of this crime by the writings 
of two Armenians and also one American. The official British report about 
this massacre mentioned in one of these documents (Lord Curzon-Aharonin 
interview) is the report of the British High Commissioner to Caucasia, 
Sir Oliver Wardrop.


""An appropriate analogy with the Jewish Holocaust might be the
 systematic extermination of the entire Muslim population of 
 the independent republic of Armenia which consisted of at 
 least 30-40 percent of the population of that republic. The 
 memoirs of an Armenian army officer who participated in and 
 eye-witnessed these atrocities was published in the U.S. in
 1926 with the title 'Men Are Like That.' Other references abound.""

There are doubts about it. Why don't you define what self-hating Jew means?
I found the idea itself of being a self-hating Jew to be one of those
rediculous things that people repeat and repeat because it seems to have a
meaning when in fact it has none.
I hope you can come up with a definition in itself and not something like:
look at this person, that is a self-hating Jew.

Providing safety and security for one's own people is the most
fundamental responsibility of any political entity. For the Palestinian
leadership to refuse to accept this responsibility, i.e. take the
responsibility to protect their people from radical Palestinian elements
who are opposed to the peace process, is reprehensible. To argue that a
Palestinian police force would be established in order to control peaceful
political groups only reinforces the reality that the Palestinian
leadership, so far, can not exercise control over radical Palestinian
elements nor effectively deal with the killing of Palestinians by
Palestinians. This is a problem that can only be solved by the
Palestinian people.

I believe that things are getting mixed here.
Critizicing Israel and/or being anti-zionist is not seeing ""the absolute 
negatives of that culture"". Maybe, because a person can see the positives 
of that culture is that that person opposes zionism and the actions of the
State of Israel.
I, for one, consider the actions of the State of Israel with respect to
the human rights of the Palestinian people as an example of an action thaty
opposes what Jewish culture was suppose to uphold as an example of 
respect and what the Jewish people learned about oppresion, segregation and
years in the diaspora.

He might not want to recognize that. It does not make him a self-hating
Jew, as far as I see it. At most, he is a person who is not telling
the truth.

But, so far, it seems that the blame is always put on ""the other"".
If you read this newsgroup, for example, Israel is never guilty by
herself. She is always responding to the actions of the ""other"", and
it goes as if the actions of Isreal do not also affect the response
of the ""other' in a cycle that never ends. Also, there is blindness to
try to understand what the other feels and why.
There is always and excuse. There is always a rationale to explain why
things happen as they do.
And, what is the worst part for me, there seems to be all the time an
intention to try to de-humanize the ""other"", as if the other did not
care about their future, children, peace, etc, etc.

This is quite a misrepresentation.  After WWI, many Bosnian Muslims were
killed and their land taken over by Serbs, and the motive was plunder,
not some fictitious ""supression of rebellion.""  Even earlier, one can
point to the destruction of mosques in Serbia itself and expulsion of
Muslims.  Here is what Dr. Vaso Cubrilovic, political adviser to the
Serbian monarchic regime, says in his memorandum ""The Expulsion of the
Arnauts"" which he presented to the royal government of Stojadinovic
on March 7, 1937, in Belgrade:

   The Mode of Removal
   -------------------

   [ describes how expulsion of ethnic Albanians from Kosova is to proceed
   through state terror and ""private initiative"", i.e. Chetnik plunder: ]

   Private initiative, too, can assist greatly in this direction.  We should
   distribute weapons to our colonists, as need be.  The old forms of Chetnik
   action should be organized and secretly assisted.  [...]
   ...the whole affair should be presented as a conflict between clans and,
   if need be, ascribed to economic reasons.  Finally, local riots can be
   incited.  These will be bloodily suppressed with the clans and the
   Chetniks, rather than the army.

   There remains one more means, WHICH SERBIA EMPLOYED WITH GREAT PRACTICAL
   EFFECT AFTER 1878, that is, by secretly burning down Albanian villages
   and city quarters.

(Emphasis above is mine.)  These events in Serbia itself forced out virtually
all Muslims during late 19th century.  This policy of state terrorism
against Muslims, aided by Chetnik ""private initiative,"" has continued in WWII
and today.  For example, Muhamed Hadzijahic in his book ""Od tradicije do 
identiteta: Geneza nacionalnog pitanja bosanskih Muslimana"" (Sarajevo:
Svjetlost, 1974) writes (pg. 235) how Serbs killed a Muslim in Foca
in WWII even though he claimed to be a Serbian patriot, explaining
their action as follows:

   ""Inasmuch as you were a Serb, you sullied the Serb name, because you
   are a Turk [i.e. Muslim].  And since you helped us, we shall not
   torture you.""

so the shot him instead of cutting his throat.  In the past year, Serbs
have repeated the slaughter of Muslim residents of Foca.  Destruction
of mosques, including priceless historical monuments, completes the
eradication of the Muslim presence from territories claimed by Serbs.

Croatia never had many Muslim citizens for historical reasons, because it
was not a part of the Ottoman Empire.  The last major battles between
Austro-Hungarian monarchy and the Ottoman Empire in Croatia were at the
end of the 17th century.  Need I remind you that modern Croatian nationalism
came into being with Dr. Ante Starcevic, who saw Bosnian Muslims as the
best Croats, so much so that in 1853 he contemplated moving his operations 
to Sarajevo?  You are confusing clericalist Croatianism with Croatian
nationalism here.   Political nationalism has always been stronger.  As
for your other theories, you are clearly overjoyed that Croat-Muslim
alliance in Bosnia-Herzegovina is now in trouble.  Arguments such as
yours are clearly intended to create and deepen this split.

In international relations 101 you'll learn that unless weak unite to
counterbalance the strong player, soon they are taken over and that's the
end of them.  Balance of power thinking has brought together Croats
and Bosnian Muslims.  This is only natural; all other alignments are
unstable.  I'm working on pointing out this basic fact: Croats and
Muslims have been aware of it for as long as Serbia has existed.  
You are wrong if you think only ""image"" is at stake here.  Croatia has
a deep interest in her alliance with Bosnian Muslims, and vice versa.  

I think Tudjman understands this, although he does not have much choice 
at this point.  Tensions should have been defused better earlier, before 
any open confrontation developed.  Although I still think Croatia will
survive, it will lose a lot; but Bosnian Muslims may end up even worse
off.  However, their position now is so horrible that perhaps they do not
see it getting any worse.  The key point is: do they still have any hope left?
If not, then all bets are off.

Mr. Stojanovic is clearly very, very happy about this.  I'm deeply hurt.
This is not about some ""image"" but about survival of a concept of a
partnership which I believe is natural and essential for both Croats
and Muslims.

Since your criminal grandparents ruthlessly exterminated more than
600,000 Kurds between 1914 and 1916 in Eastern Anatolia. Referring to 
notes from the personal diary of Russian General L. Odishe Liyetze on 
the Turkish front, he wrote,

""On the nights 11-12 March, 1918 alone Armenian butchers 
 bayoneted and axed to death 3000 Muslims in areas surrounding
 Erzincan. These barbars threw their victims into pits, most
 likely dug according to their sinister plans to extinguish 
 Muslims, in groups of 80. My adjutant counted and unearthed
 200 such pits. This is an act against our world of civilization.""

On March 12, 1918 Lieut-colonel Griyaznof wrote (from an official
Russian account of the Turkish genocide),

""Roads leading to villages were littered with bayoneted torsos,
 dismembered joints and carved out organs of Muslim peasants...
 alas! mainly of women and children.""

        (Acting Commander of Erzurum and Deveboynu regions and Commander
        of the Second Erzurum Artillery Regiment Prisoner of War,
        Lieutenant Colonel Toverdodleyov)

""The things I have heard and seen during the two months, until the
 liberation of Erzurum by the Turks, have surpassed all the
 allegations concerning the vicious, degenerate characteristic of
 the Armenians. During the Russian occupation of Erzurum, no Armenian
 was permitted to approach the city and its environs.

 While the Commander of the First Army Corps, General Kaltiyin remained
 in power, troops including Armenian enlisted men, were not sent to the
 area. When the security measures were lifted, the Armenians began to 
 attack Erzurum and its surroundings. Following the attacks came the
 plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder
 of the owners of these houses...Plundering was widely committed by
 the soldiers. This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers
 who had remained in the rear during the war.

 One day, while passing through the streets on horseback, a group of
 soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of
 seventy years in a certain direction. The roads were covered with mud,
 and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud
 and dirt...

 It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and
 traps. The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds
 and withdrew. The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night
 patrol did not return, and no one knew what had happened to them. The 
 Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear
 also. Finally, the Court Martial which had been established for the
 trials of murderers and plunderers, began to liquidate itself for
 fear that they themselves would be punished. The incidents of murder
 and rape, which had decreased, began to occur more frequently.

 Sometime in January and February, a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir
 Efendi from Erzurum, was killed one night at his home. The Commander
 in Chief (Odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days.
 The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals
 that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its
 highest point, that they had insulted and robbed the people and half
 of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned.

 ...We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief,
 Odishelidge. They were as follows:

 The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers, and the
 act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades...
 More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been
 killed in Erzincan. Large holes were dug and the defenceless 
 Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. Later, the
 murdered Turks were thrown into the holes. The Armenian who stood 
 near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses:
 'Seventy dead bodies, well, this hole can take ten more.' Thus ten
 more Turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when
 the hole was full it would be covered over with soil.

 The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently
 fill a house with eighty Turks, and cut their heads off one by one.
 Following the Erzincan massacre, the Armenians began to withdraw
 towards Erzurum... The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew
 to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road, and
 destroyed the entire population, together with the villages.

 During the transportation of the cannons, ammunition and the carriages
 that were outside the war area, certain people were hired among the 
 Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. While the travellers
 were passing through Erzurum, the Armenians took advantage of the time
 when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill
 the Kurds they had hired. When the Russian soldiers heard the cries
 of the dying Kurds, they attempted to help them. However, the 
 Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would
 have the same fate if they intervened, and thus prevented them from
 acting. All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with
 hatred and loathing.

 Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that
 he witnessed in Erzurum as follows: An Armenian had shot a Kurd. The
 Kurd fell down but did not die. The Armenian attempted to force the
 stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd. However, since
 the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the Armenian failed
 in his attempt. Having seen this, the Armenian ripped open the abdomen
 of the Kurd, disembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping
 him with the iron heel of his boot.

 Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape
 from the village of Ilica were killed. Their heads had been cut off
 by axes. He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered
 children. Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov, who passed through the village
 of Ilica, three weeks after the massacre told us the following:

 There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces, on the roads.
 Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and
 spat on the corpses. In the courtyard of a mosque which was about
 25x30 meter square, dead bodies were piled to a height of 140 
 centimeters. Among these corpses were men and women of every age,
 children and old people. The women's bodies had obvious marks of
 rape. The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder.

 A few educated Armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators
 for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov
 to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be 
 proud of what the Armenians had done. To the lieutenant colonel's
 disgusted amazement, the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle,
 instead of being horrified. The lieutenant colonel had severely
 reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. When he told
 the girls that the Armenians, including women, were generally more
 licentious than even the wildest animals, and that their indecent
 and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity
 and barbarity, before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers,
 the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and
 claimed they had laughed because they were nervous.

 An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command
 narrated the following incident which took place on February 20:

 The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall. They had cut
 out the women's heart and placed the heart on top of her head.
 The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7... The enlisted men 
 of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. Then they
 took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people
 among this group were able to save their lives as the result of
 my decisive attempts. The others, the Armenians claimed, were 
 released when they learnt that I understood what was going on. 
 Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the
 Armenian officers, Karagodaviev. Today, some Turks were murdered
 on the streets.

 On February 12, some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent
 Moslems. The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were
 threatened with death. Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for
 murdering an innocent Turk. 

 When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would 
 be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: 'How dare
 you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk?' In Erzurum, the 
 Armenians burned down the Turkish market. On February 17, I heard
 that the entire population of Tepekoy village, situated within
 the artillery area, had been totally annihilated. On the same 
 day when Antranik entered Erzurum, I reported the massacre to
 him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible
 act. However no result was achieved.

 In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred, there was a
 natural silence. On the night of 26/27 February, the Armenians deceived
 the Russians, perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the 
 Turkish soldiers. Later, it was understood that this massacre had
 been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular. 
 The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed
 one by one. The number of murders committed on that night reached
 three thousand. It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details
 of the massacre. The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers
 were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even
 withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred
 people and two cannons, for one night, and ran away. The leading
 Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre.
 However, the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with
 the renegades in this massacre, just as in all the others. The lower
 classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders
 of the leading Armenian figures and commanders. 

 I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals
 were accessories to these murders. No, for there were people who
 opposed the Armenians for such actions, since they understood that
 it would yield no result. However, such people were only a minority.
 Furthermore, such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian
 cause. Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have
 supported the massacres secretly. Some, on the other hand, preferred
 to remain silent. There were certain others, who, when accused by
 the Russians of infamy, would say the following: 'You are Russians.
 You can never understand the Armenian cause.' The Armenians had a
 conscience. They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear
 of the Turkish soldiers.

 The incidents that occurred only recently clearly manifest the real
 nature of the Armenian ideology. Nothing which is already done can
 be undone.""

  All Muslims knew that the whole thing was set up to destroy Iraq, not 
  to ""Liberate Kuwait"", The people who were killed by the invasion are 
  more (many many more), than the ones that were killed by the Iraqis 
  in their smaller invasion. I lived in the west, and I have seen how 
  your media prepared you (helpless naive Americans) for a war against 
                                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
No doubt you plan on exploiting ""helpless naive Americans"" for your own
purposes. Hmm...let's see: 

  Iraq even before the artificial conflict between Iraq and Kuwait that 
  led to the invasion, as the CIA correctly predicted (and pretended to 
  be surprised not to know). 
  It just happened that Saddam was so predictible and so arrogant and stupid. 

  What would I have done: Most Muslims would choose 300 dead Kuwaitis   over 
  200,000 dead Iraqis and 1000 dead Kuwaitis. The first case would happen 
  if no western intervention happened, and the second case was a direct 
  or indirect result of western envolvement. 

Possibly, if 200,000 Iraqis had indeed died, but this number is based on
Greenpeace estimates.  Greenpeace had compromised its alleged
impartiality during the war by condemning the potential environmental
consequences of Allied miiltary action, while initially *completely*
ignoring Iraq's horrible environmental crimes, starting with the dumping
of millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf at Ahmadi to the blowing of
over 700 oil wells.  What is the real number?  There has been a lot of
work on this in the last two years, none of it reported as the
Greenpeace figure seems to get continuously bandied about.  The real
number seems to be around 10,000, on the same order as the number of
Kuwaitis killed, tortured and kidnapped during the occupation.  I've
included an article I recently posted below, but this is really old
news.  Independent Television News reported a figure around 15,000 only
a few months after the war, but it was hardly reported. 

For the Allies to have killed 200,000 Iraqis, they would have had to
kill twice the *total* number of Iraqis in Kuwait. 

The favored image of the hysterics is the last battle of the war at
Mutla'.  This was yet another example of the American and European media
playing into the hands of Iraq and its de facto allies.     The
destruction of the Iraqi convoy at Mutla' was portrayed as an all-out
slaughter.  This is simply not true.  The head and tail of the convoy
was bombed initially, resulting in a lot of casualties at these points. 
 Before bombers came back, most of the rest of the Iraqi soldiers fled
on foot. 

Furthermore, your estimates of Kuwaiti war dead if Allies hadn't invaded
is completely ridiculous.  You have acknowledged (certainly implicitly) 
 that Saddam is a barbarous brute.  You have acknowledged the hundreds
of thousands he has been responible for killing *in his own country*. 
You *know* that the man he appointed as governor of Kuwait,  Ali Majid,
was his most brutal henchman, presiding over the near genocide of the
Kurds  in the late 80's and, more recently, the Shi'a.    Yet, when it
comes to his treatment of Kuwaitis, he is an angel.  In your estimate,
he would've killed *fewer* than he already had when the war started. 
What a joke! 


APn  03/09 0006  Iraq War Dead 

Copyright, 1993. The Associated Press. All rights reserved. 

By NICK LUDINGTON 
 Associated Press Writer 
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After the Persian Gulf War ended, the world was
told that 
as many as 100,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed. At one point, even Baghdad put 
the toll that high, as did the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency in private. 
   But U.S. officials have been backpedaling ever since, even though the 
Pentagon has yet to settle on an official estimate to release to the public. 
Now, one former DIA analyst says the number of Iraqi troops killed may
have been 
as low as 1,500. 
   That conclusion by John Heidenrich, writing in the current issue of the 
quarterly magazine Foreign Policy, represents the lowest estimate yet
from U.S. 
defense sources. 
   The revisions suggesting a less devastating Iraqi toll fit a pattern of 
vastly moderated U.S. military claims in the months after the war ended.
Claims 
for a number of U.S. weapons also were scaled down. 
   Despite the dramatic videotapes of successful weaponry or the shocking 
pictures of Iraq's disastrous retreat from Kuwait, arguments have continued 
unabated about what really happened in the Gulf War. 
   Heidenrich is not the first to question the Iraqi death toll numbers that 
originally were aired. More that a year ago, Air Force Lt. Gen. Charles
Horner, 
the commander of the air campaign in the Gulf War, said he believed the Iraqi 
military death toll was fewer than 10,000 for the entire war. 
   The Pentagon itself still refuses to provide an estimate of the number of 
Iraqis who died in the 42-day war against the U.S.-led coalition in
January and 
February 1991. On Monday, Pentagon spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Joe Gradisher
reiterated 
past statements that ""there just isn't a number,"" that is credible. 
   But some current internal estimates range from 8,000 to 25,000 Iraqi troops 
killed, said one analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity, who is familiar 
with the Pentagon's reports. 
   Allied deaths were put at 146 Americans, 35 by friendly fire; 24 British, 9 
by American fire; 2 Frenchmen, 1 Italian and 39 among various Arab allies. 
   Of the postwar reassessments, the most widely publicized was the Army's 
reluctant acknowledgement, months later, that its touted Patriot air defense 
system was nowhere near so effective as claimed against Iraq's Scud missiles. 
The Bush administration initially claimed an almost perfect record for the 
Patriot; last spring it revised the hit ratio to 60 percent. 
   The success record of the Navy's Tomahawk high-tech cruise missile used 
against targets in Baghdad and other parts of Iraq also turned out to be more 
modest than initially indicated by the Pentagon. 
   The first Iraqi casualty figures to surface after the war came in a
May 1991 
report by the environmental group Greenpeace, which said 100,000 to 120,000 
Iraqi soldiers were killed. It estimated that 5,000 to 15,000 Iraqi civilians 
were also killed. 
   The same month, published reports said the Defense Intelligence Agency 
estimated 100,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed and 300,000 wounded in the
air and 
ground campaigns -- although the agency qualified that by saying the estimate 
could be off by as much as 50 percent in either direction. 
   But as more information became available, those figures gradually were 
revised downward. 
   The House Armed Services Committee staff estimated 9,000 dead and 17,000 
wounded after a review last year. 
   But Heidenrich, writing in the current issue of the quarterly Foreign
Policy, 
estimated the total death toll from both the air and ground offensives
as low as 
1,500 -- with about 3,000 wounded. 
   Heidenrich based the conclusion in his article on the number of
bodies found 
and buried by U.S. troops -- 577 -- and on prisoner of war interviews.
He noted 
that only about 2,000 of 69,000 Iraqi prisoners of war were wounded. 
   Based on the calculation that about half as many wounded escaped as were 
captured, he put the number of wounded at about 3,000. Using a conservative 
ratio of one dead to two wounded, applicable to Third World armies like
Iraq, he 
set battlefield deaths at 1,500. 
   ""Maybe the figures are too low,"" he wrote. ""Maybe the real death toll
on the 
battlefield was 2,000 or 3,000 or even 6,000. Even then, the evidence
suggests a 
death toll of well below 100,000 -- or even 10,000."" 
   In an interview, he said the 100,000 figure was obviously off base
because it 
would mean that virtually all the Iraqi soldiers in the Kuwait theater of 
operations were casualties. 
   He said today's bloodiest wars were not those fought with high technology, 
but rather the drawn-out conflicts such as those in Yugoslavia and Somalia.

Armenians have been doing just that for a long, long time.

Source: ""Hagop Hagopian said to have been part of 1972 Terror Attack at
Munich Olympic Games,"" The Armenian Reporter, February 7, 1985, p. 1.

""Le Matin, the influential Paris daily, based on unidentified sources,
claimed last week that Hagop Hagopian, the founder and leader of one
faction of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA),
was among the Arab terrorists who staged an attack on the living quarters
of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympic Games...

Le Matin added that up to 1982, Hagopian operated out of Beirut, Lebanon,
but escaped from the country when Israeli forces entered the city. It was
about this time that a statement issued by ASALA claimed that Mr. Hagopian
was dead of wounds suffered during a bombing by the Israeli Air Force,
although it is generally believed that the mysterious leader is alive and
well and presently is residing alternately in Damascus, Syria, and
Athens, Greece. The paper also noted that the socialist government of
Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and his P.A.S.O.K. party accepted the
Armenian underground leader with ""open arms"" and still providing him
with assistance simply because of Greece's traditional enmity with Turkey.

Le Matin further adds that ASALA derives only a small portion of its
expenditures from wealthy Armenians who support the cause, with the rest 
coming either from other sources or from proceeds of an involvement in
drug trafficking.""

Nobody ever produced the meagerest evidence for this.  It does not
appear in several long published accounts by Irgun participants.
Even some Irgun propagandists do not make this claim.

Several members of the Irgun attacking party, including the leader,
deposited personal declarations in the Irgun archives (Jabotinsky
Institute, Tel-Aviv) which state that the Lehi proposed to ""liquidate
the village after the conquest"".  It seems the Begin overruled
this plan, however the willingness of many of the attackers to
seriously consider this possibility serves as instructive
character evidence.

>The village was attacked only for its military significance. 

The Haganah tried to get the Irgun to attack a village with
real military significance, but it was considered too hard.  
The soft target of Deir Yassin was chosen instead.

>In fact,

There was intention (probably originating with Begin) to give such
a warning but the loudspeaker truck got stuck in a ditch before
reaching the village.  Everyone knows that.

This account from Eric Silver is the only valid point that M&F makes.
You can find it together with other evidence and analysis in 
Silver's biography of Begin.  Also in Silver's book you will find
documentary evidence that nearly everything else in M&F's account
is pure bullshit.

This is pretty disgusting.  The Guardian was told of one or two

I hope, I hope, that we can begin to involve ourselves in the issues
and concerns related to this peace process. We have differing opinions,
certainly, on these aspects but it is clear that we all share the hope
that ""resolution"" of the tensions and conflict **will** happen.

As we ""run to the defense"" of our side, there is no need to constantly 
involve ourselves in name-calling. All of us are regularly confused by
the ""other's"" reactive posting because ""they"" spend most of the post
applying ""labels"" and presenting slogans than in just presenting their
honest views. Then...when we ""react"", we do the same thing.

Do you, as I do, agree that this (sort) of ""peace process"" is needed?
What about the particular points mentioned in the article? Is what

Not far enough?

If you don't agree that a ""peace process"" is needed, what is?

first amendment to the US Constitution.

   Steve

I do not say that freedom of speech should be banned. Far from it.
I am merely suggesting that there are certain things which can be
universally agreed to be morally incorrect. There are not many such
things. But there are some. As an example:

(1) murder is morally incorrect

(2) the idea that one group of people is somehow racially inferior to
another is morally incorrect

etc.

The point is that any action which serves to promote a morally
incorrect action should be forbidden. This implies that no one has the
right to say that an innocent person should be murdered. Regardless of
freedom of speech, I may not stand on a street corner and advocate the
murder of innocent people. The reason for this is that murder is a
morally incorrect action.

In the same way, since bigotry is morally incorrect in the narrow
definition which we have given it, (2), I, nor any one else, has the
right to stand on a street corner and promote bigotry. Such an
enforcement does in no way deny any one their rights as guaranteed by
the first amendment. It merely ensures that no person may be the
target of an attempt to deny him a fundamental moral right, such as
the right to not be murdered, and the right not to be discriminated
against.

I believe, Mr. Berson, that to blindly accept the constitution is a
terrific mistake. We must cinstantly question the constitution and
interpret it in a way befitting the society in which we live. Anything
short of such an effort would render us little more than trained
monkeys, who are able to merely repeat what they have heard without
paying the slightest bit of attention to the intent of the document in
question.

Would you disagree, Mr.Berson?

Harry.

	   Actually, You're wrong as well. The KKK is allowed to
   march and any attempts to curtail their freedom is rejected
   (Actually I believe the ACLU won a case for them last year). 
	   Morality should not be legilated in a free country like
   the U.S. 

Yes. That seems to be the problem. Even Germany now has laws for its
military where soldiers are *required* to disobey orders if they
believe the orders are morally incorrect.

Naziism is prohibited in Canada, Germany (others?). How pray tell is
Canda any less free than the US?

""It seems that terrorism against their own co-nationals has been a prominent
 part of the revolutionary activities of the Dashnag leaders of the Caucasus.
 Organized to fight the Turks, these chieftains have been more successful
 in their fight against their Armenian opponents in Turkey, and the Caucasus,
 very often defenseless and innocent.""

""The fact remains, however, that the leaders of the Turkish Armenian section
 of the Dashnagtzoutune did not carry out their promise of loyalty to the
 Turkish cause when the Turks entered the war...and a call was sent for 
 Armenian volunteers to fight the Turks on the Caucasian front.""

During the First World War and the ensuing years - 1914-1920, 
the Armenian Dictatorship through a premeditated and systematic 
genocide, tried to complete its centuries-old policy of 
annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 
2.5 million Muslims and deporting the rest from their 1,000 year 
homeland.

The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance
of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people.

So, the Greek educational system is also in a shambles. History shows 
that within the last 170 years, Greeks played that game twice: They 
used Istanbul Patriarch Grigorios in 1822 to instigate the Morea 
rebellion that resulted in the massacres of the Muslim people. Again, 
the Orthodox Patriarch Constantine V invited the Russian Czar Nicholas 
II to invade the Ottoman Empire 'in the name of Jesus,' and save his 
flock from Ottoman rule.

In the words of Professor Skiotis, ""With savage jubilance, [the Greeks]
sang the words 'Let no Turk remain in the Morea, nor in the whole world.'
The Greeks were determined to achieve to 'Romaiko' in the only way they
knew how: through a war of religious extermination.""

Let me further improve this one for you. After the Ottoman Empire lost 
World War I, the British landed in 1919 a 200,000 Greek army in Izmir 
to exterminate the people of Turkiye. Are you suffering from a severe 
case of amnesia? The tired and defeated Turks rose up, formed a National 
Force under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal, and on August 30, 1922 they 
annihilated the bulk of the Greek Army.

Now wait, there is more.

  <<The Greek War of Independence brought disaster to the Jewish communities
  in the Peloponnesos, where the revolution erupted in 1821. The Jews,
  because of their close association with the Ottoman administration,
  were massacred along with the Turks. The Jewish communities of Mistras,
  Tripolis, and Kalamata were decimated; the few survivors moved north to
  settle in Chalkis and Volos, still under Ottoman rule. Patras lost its
  ancient Jewish community, which was refounded only in 1905.>>

  <<...the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire which had been going on
  for a century was disastrous for Ottoman Jewry. This was the age of
  nationalism among the Christian subjects of the Sultan, starting with
  the Greek Revolution early in the nineteenth century, which, based on
  the Megali Idea, or Great Idea, sought to add to Greek kingdom Istanbul
  and large portions of Anatolia, union of which with Greece was felt to be
  the 'dream and hope of all'. The success of the Greek national movement,
  provided more in fact by the intervention of the Great Powers than by the
  efforts of the Greeks themselves, stimulated similar uprisings among the
  other subjects in Southeastern Europe who had long been oppressed, not so
  much by the Ottomans but, rather, by the Greek religious hierarchy which
  dominated the Orthodox millet, leading first to pressure for religious
  independence, granted to the Bulgarian Orthodox Exarchate in 1870, to the
  Serbian Church in 1879, and to the Rumanian Church in 1885, with subsequent
  aspirations for, and achievement of, political independence following...>>

  page 188:

  <<...They [new nationalist leaders] were greatly assisted in their
   campaigns against the Ottomans both by the diplomatic and consular
   representatives of the major Powers of Europe and also by Christian
   missionaries, who emphasized feelings of Christian superiority and
   hatred for Muslims and Jews which fortified the religious as well as
   ethnic bases of their pursuit of independence.

   Christian nationalism, based as much on religious as on ethnic identity,
   soon resurrected the medieval bigotries which had devastated both Jews
   and Muslims and consequently had driven them together in the past.
   Vicious anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic movements developed, involving
   large-scale persecutions and massacres carried out by invading armies,
   by the independent states that resulted, also by Christian subjects
   who remained within the Empire, particularly because of Jewish and Muslim
   support for Ottoman integrity in fear of their fate in the emergent
   nationalist states of Southeastern Europe. The results were explosive
   and damaging.

   The invading armies of Russia and Austria as well as the revolting
   nationalists and, later, successfully established independent Christian
   states, committed systematic genocide against Jews and Muslims throughout
   the nineteenth century, despite Great Power admonitions to the contrary
   in the treaties of Paris (1858) and Berlin (1878),...>>

  page 188:

  <<...As the peoples of Southeastern Europe achieved their independence,
   their Muslim and Jewish minorities were systematically persecuted and
   massacred, and those who survived were driven beyond the ever-shrinking
   boundaries of the retreating Ottoman Empire in a kind of slaughter which
   had not been seen since the dispersal of the Jews from Palestine centuries
   earlier.

   This sort of genocide had begun as long before as the late sixteenth
   century, with the Rumanian Principalities taking the lead, as united
   Rumania did subsequently during the later years of the nineteenth
   century. In 1579 the ruler of Moldavia, Peter the Lame, banished its
   Jews because of their competition with its Christian merchants. When
   Prince Micheal the Brave revolted against the Ottomans in the Rumanian
   principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia in 1593, he ordered the massacre
   of all the Jews as well as Turks in Bucharest.>>

  page 189:

  <<The slaughter continued well into the nineteenth century. When the
  Greeks revolted against Ottoman rule many Greek volunteers coming from
  Russia and the Principalities to join in the effort slaughtered and
  plundered the Jewish communities along their paths as they went through
  Moldavia and Wallachia toward Greece.>>

  page 190 (second paragraph):

  <<When Venice occupied the island of Chios in 1694, its Jewish population
   was either massacred or deported and all Jewish communal and personal
   property was stolen by the native Greek population, leaving those Jews
   who returned in utter poverty and reduced to begging, no longer able to
   compete with the Greeks in trade or commerce.>>

  page 190 (third paragraph):

  <<Jews living in Greece and the Rumanian principalities suffered terribly
   because of their support for Ottoman rule. When the Greek nationalist
   movement Philike Etairia started its uprising in Wallachia and Moldavia
   during the spring of 1821, hundreds of Jews and Muslims were killed by
   the Greeks who lived there as well as by native Wallachs [14]. During
   the height of the Greek revolution, five thousand Jews were massacred
   in Morea along with most of the Muslim population, numbering about
   twenty thousand in all [15]. In Tripolizza alone 1,200 Jews were
   massacred along with uncounted Turks [16].  Reverend John Hartley,
   after describing the carnage, concluded 'Thus did Jewish blood, mingled
   with Turkish, flow down the streets of captured city. The sons of Isaac
   and the sons of Ishmael, on this as well as on every occasion during the
   Greek Revolution, met with common fate. Their corpses were cast out of the
   city, and, like the ancient sovereign of Judah, they received no burial
   superior to that of an ass.' [17] Jewish communities on the islands of
   Sparta, Patras, Corinthos, Mistra, and Argos were wiped out by bands of
   Greek rebels along with those of Thebes, Vrachori, Attica and Epirus [18].
   The surviving Jews fled to the island of Corfu, where Jews who had fled
   from Italy, and the Iberian Peninsula had lived in peace and prosperity
   under the Venetian rule since the twelfth century, though divided into
   rival Greek and Italian communities. It was not long, however, before
   it too fell victim to the Greek Revolution, leading to savage repression
   and massacres of Jews, forcing the surviving members of the two communities
   to come together for self-defense for the first time. Throughout the years
   of Greek revolution, Greek nationalists went from town to town on the
   mainland and from island to island in the Agean, exterminating all the
   Jews and Muslims they could find, many along the roads as they desperately
   fled to safety in what was left of the Ottoman Empire. Contemporary
   accounts relate that the Greeks left the murdered Jews and Muslims lying
   exposed so their bodies could be torn apart by the buzzards [19]. Most of
   the Jews who survived these massacres fled across the Agean in small boats
   to Izmir, thus starting its rise as one of the leading centers of Ottoman
   Jewish life during the nineteenth century. Only in Northern Greece,
   particularly in the areas of Janina and Salonica, were the Jews and the
   Turks able to successfully resist the Greek assaults, thus saving their
   populations from massacre as well [20]. During the remainder of the 19th
   century, particularly during the Greek-Turkish war in 1897, those Jews
   who remained in Greece in the areas of Athens, Chalkis, Larissa, Corfu
   and Crete suffered severe persecution and massacre, forcing thousands
   more to emigrate into Ottoman territory, particularly to Salonica and
   Izmir [21].>>

   page 193 (last paragraph):

   <<The inclusion in the Treaty of Berlin of stipulations providing
   protection for the Jewish and Muslim minorities in Southeastern Europe
   stimulated more popular anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim hysteria in all
   the countries involved, with blood-libel accusations once again being
   used as pretexts for attacking and ravaging Jewish quarters as well as
   for new tactics for boycotting Jewish shopkeepers, merchants and
   professionals, a movement which was quickly adapted by the Christian
   millets in the major cities of the Ottoman Empire. Because the Bulgarians,
   Rumanians and Greeks correctly regarded the Jews as supporters of the
   Turks, both Jews and Turks were expelled from these countries in equally
   atrocious and brutal manners. Their property was plundered and their
   homes and shops taken over without compensation, while the survivors
   fled in desperation to Edirne and Istanbul. While official statements
   subsequently were issued granting equal rights to Jews, little was done
   in fact and they continued to be persecuted regularly well into the
   twentieth century.>>

  page 194 (last paragraph):

  <<Things were not much better elsewhere in Southeastern Europe or the
   Greek islands of the Agean and the eastern Mediterranean. In 1891 the
   Jews on Corfu were subjected to severe persecution by local Greeks due
   to the revival of the old ritual murder accusations [26]. Many of
   those who survived found refuge in Ottoman territory with the help of a
   popular subscription drive carried out in Istanbul under leadership of
   the Banque Camondo. In 1881 and 1884, and again in 1892 and 1903,
   thousands of Jews came to Ottoman territory as a result of pogroms
   in Russia which went on between 1881 and 1921 with only slight periods
   of respite. In 1899 Jewish families arrived in Istanbul in flight from
   persecution in Vidin, in independent Bulgaria.

   The conquest of Ottoman Thrace and Macedonia by Greek and Bulgarian
   forces during the Balkan Wars (1912-13), including Salonica, Corlu,
   and Edirne, was followed by general attacks on Jews, their synagogues,
   homes and shops, in both countries [27], resulting in a renewed exodus
   toward Istanbul and beyond. Two reports from Salonica graphically
   described the situation caused by the invading armies:

      'All the self-interested justifications of the newspapers of Europe,
      all the lies which they have used to cover up the truth, can never
      destroy the impression of the terrible anguish which has marked the
      entry of the Greeks in Salonica. A week of terror and horror one can
      never easily forget. The Hellenes now cruelly feel today all the
      damage that the explosion of hatred by the (Greek) population has done
      to their cause. The mob has shown itself odious and the government
      weak...The incompetence of the Greek administration and the horrors
      inflicted by the soldiers has put them in a terrible situation. The
      consuls guaranteed the absolute safety of the Muslims, but sixty of
      them were massacred in a single night....'[28]

     'It wasn't only irregulars (Comitacis) who massacred, pillaged and
      burned. The soldiers of the Army, the Chief of Police, and the high
      civil officials took an active part in the events at Serres. Out of
      6,000 houses, 4,000 were burned. Almost 1,200 shops were consumed by
      flames and destructive bombs. The (Jewish) population lost all, and
      without even anything to wear is in despair. Everyone wants to
      emigrate...'[29]

Israel?

	You make the odd assumption that I read Israeli papers, not

	Also, I do on rare occaisons, read Arab papers, but its hard
to find English language papers from Arab countries here.

	Have I ever claimed to be objective?  I pointed out, with a 27

not condemned for.  You go off and attack me for reading only Israeli
newspapers.

	If you'd like to debate this, please do.  If you'd like to

So, Mr. Salah is still claiming Stalin was a Jew? 

This thread began on SCA, when he and another guy claimed both Stalin
and Lenin were Jews. When I posted evidence from books and the Britannica
showing they were Christians, someone made the (correct) remark that
Lenin's maternal grandfather was a Jew who converted to Christianity.

To counter the fact that Stalin was a Christian who, during his youth,
was trained to be a priest, Mr. Salah wrote ""yes, it says he was trained
to be a priest, but not for what religion!"" (BTW, Stalin developed
strong antisemitic feelings later in his life).

Mr. Salah seems intent on trying to spread hate against Jews by posting
antisemitic forgeries and trying to ""prove"" that certain notorious
people were Jews, even if they were not.

No, because I don't like the weather back East. However, it would bother me

O.K., in the U.S., tell me about some of these deaths and some of these
unliveable areas. Oh, and if you manage to find some of these unliveable
areas, tell me what percentage of the total US land area they are.
(Hint - the total waste produced by all nuclear reactors in the US can be

Here in Georgia, the state legislature in 1992 ""accidentally passed a law

giving shots. They were trying to limit Optometrists from competing with
them.
They inadvertantly forbade nurses, EMTs, dentists, and tattoo artists

office announced on June 30th that they wouldn't enforce it pending
reconsideration in the 1003 Legislature. In the hassle over the state flag

The person who murdered 17 children was Koresh. He kept them there and 
brought about their deaths deliberately.

You may consider that I am a complete bastard and a not very nice chap.
Thats quite true. I don't pretend to be. Being nice is what amateurs
try to do. If you want to talk politics you are talking hard decisions
such as whether the lives of the troops should be risked attempting
to rescue the children. Anyone who has held the office of President
of the United States since FDR has held the threat that if the USA
or its allies were to be threatened then the USA would risk nuclear 
Holocaust in order to protect freedom. Beleive it or not, that is not
the sort of threat that nice chaps make. Do they have a gun nutters
section of the US version of CND by any chance?


There are cases where society has to be protected from
madmen such as Koresh or Hitler. If it were not for the consideration
of the 17 children in there the question of the tactics to be used would
not be a matter of anything but academic significance. It is not for
the govt to prevent people from commiting mass suicide.

The latest reports are that cult members were shot attempting to
leave the compound by Koresh loyalists during the fire. If proven
that would entail the final nail in the coffin of those who want to
promote Koresh as some sort of role model or hero.


I need hardly add that it is Koresh that has created the Holocaust in
this case by the deliberate arson of the ranch appocalypse.

Hehehe!  Dontcha just love these carefully constructed arguements?

Clayton, babe, please define the word `molest`.  Are you using a legal
term or a proper dictionary term?  Molest, as far as I can remember, means
`to do damage to person(s)`.  My mate, Mike, was lured into a woman's parlour
when he was 14.  Is that molestation?  A number of my friends (straight) lost
their virginity before that.  Were they 'molested'?  They told me that they
thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  I see no damage.  

Please stop pushing your objective morality on others.  If you push, people won't
fall over and say 'Ye gads, you're right!', they'll just push back.

Oh are we Jill?  Let me tell you a story then...

One evening not long in this country a man, a parolee, a convicted KNOWN 
violent crimminal lead police on high speed chase after breaking another law.
He decided that police had no right to do their jobs and enforce the law
and assualted two of while attempting to resist arrest.  When police use
metal sticks to force him into submission we heard all the reason why certain
people in this country have and excuse when they refuse to obey the law, 
how this was a perfect example of police oppression, how all the police
had to do was behave a certain way and all would have been finei, how nothing
the victim did could have possibly warranted the response - some blows with
a few sticks - he got from the authorities.

Funny, how when it's Bloodbath Billy or his hitwench calling the shots,
a group of people who were bothering no one, were not know to have broken 
any law, who asked only that they be left alone to practice their religion
as they fit, how it is now that the government is justified in assualting
those people with 100 heavily armed commandos simply because the gun 
grabbers in DC thought these people had more guns thay they thought they
should have.  Now when it's the Clinton administration that has the blood
of dozens on its hand AAAALL of a sudden it's the people who refused to
have their civil rights violated, it's their fault, those evil fanatics
provoked it...

How is it in the mind of the liberal Democrat-Clinton supporter that a
crimminal puke, scum bag, piece of garbage like Rodney King could not have

Put up or shut up. Where is your evidence?
Show a study indicating a link between liking >>GROWN UPS<< of the same
sex and liking children. Saying that 30% of molested children are male
shows nothing since it tells you nothing of the molesters preference
in adults (if they have any at all).

The above conveniently ignores the murder of four BATF agents by the
Branch Davidians in an unprovoked ambush.

Any government that allows tinpot dictators to set up shop and declare
a private state has drifted into anarchy. There are laws to control
the ownership of guns and the BATF had good reason to beleive that
they were being violated. They set out to obtain a legal warrant and 
attempted to serve it only to be met with gunfire when they rang
the doorbell.

The paranoid assertion that the BATF fired first in an unprovoked
assault assumes that the BATF were on a death wish. Had they
expected the B-D to be anything other than peacefull citizens who
would accept a search authorized by a court they would have turned up
in a tank and broken the door down on day one.

The stupidity was the attempt to serve a warant on the place by
ludicrously underarmed and unprotected police. 


If anyone on the net cares to suggest a sure fire method of bringing
the murderes of four police officers to justice perhaps we could
hear it.

When you buy insurance where you live, it is based on the local rates.
Tourists coming from, say, Utah will find that there is a difference

It would depend on where you live, downtown Toronto or Mile 101,
British Columbia (just like Cheyenne, WY vs. Boston, MA).  Again,
geography rears its ugly head.

Since our health care providers are private, they depend on an
adequate market size in order to sustain enough business.  Since
our health care professionals have equivalent take-home pay to 
their American cousins, it's not that they're being paid too
little to provide services.

I have only hear Americans say that it's illegal ... but I could be
wrong, just have never heard it from a Canadian source.  our private
insurance has recently balked in Quebec when the Liberals proposed
privatizing some aspects of routine care ... also, our insurance was
put in place when no NDP (Labour) governments were in power in any
province to derail the effort 'cos they wanted real socialized
medicine.

>You're not buying insurance so much as being coerced into one 
>insurance plan.

No, it is optional ... as it is optional for doctors to accept it.
There are isolated religeous communities in particular that ask for
exemptions (and one e-mail from a Christian Scientist in Edmonton
verified for me that it is indeed negative option).  I guess that you
can argue that there is a right to having a particular insurance, but
so far I've not come across that up north ... and I take pains to keep
tabs with news from home.

>And that turns the private insurers offering the frills into an

Believe me, they probably had orgasms when they figured that out.  And
according to my sister the yuppie, they pat themselves on the back to
the point of ungraciousness at Chamber of Commerce luncheons.

>(Interesting side note-have any new insurance companies started
>up-from scratch-since Medicare became standard in Canada?

I actually have doubts that any new ones have emerged since WW I ...
no, scratch that ... there are a few in Western Canada, and *quite* 
a few in Quebec as part of the post-1980 Quebec Miracle (out with the
nationalism, in with the French capitalism).  La Groupe des Cooper-
antes built a new tower by the Eaton('s) store at Les Terraces, and if
you were able to catch Urban Angel on CBS's Crimetime you'd see it as
the well-lit one with double-turrets at the top.  As for Ontario,
which still dominates and anchors business up north ...

Canada is a very old-money kind of place, and the 1989 Free Trade
Agreement saw a lot of odd alliances: labour unions and establishment
old money who wanted to preserve their traditional monopolies on one
side, and entrepreneurs and internationally oriented businesses and
professionals on the other.  The final Trudeau administration and
the first Mulroney government had a high percentage of nouveaux
riches who knew what it was like to make your own money, and that
motivated the McDonald Commission under Trudeau which set up Brian's
initiative (Macaroni was against free trade 'til he did a head count
of his caucus after the 1984 election).

>It's not really insurance if you don't have alternatives

Well, you have to realize that in our society that's like saying
that ""it's not really national defence"" because you can't hire
your own Rambo squad instead or even opting out as a pacifist.
(BTW, there are always pacifists in the news arguing about their
portion of taxes, but never people arguing over health insurance
alternatives ... and we're talking about a press that is hostile
to whomever is in government, regardless of party; one of their
few redeeming characteristics, it seems (-;).

The only way to hit at the Canadian system is transient periods of
high demand, which is more a function of the doctors monopoly's tight
fist on the licencing.  An obvious difference is that in such a
transient period, the rationing is of the nature of a mob battling
over Cabbage Patch Dolls^TM as we've seen recently as opposed by
rationing by ability to pay ... but the former is a *transient*
situation and if a large body of insured patients were to deluge the
California health infrastructure, the same would result --- rationing
among the insured population.  With smaller markets, there is much
less flexibility when dealing with our insured population than
California (which by the way, has 1/3rd more people than Canada in a
MUCH more dense area).  So he is correct in that the resources are
fixed (for a particular time window, or as a function of the doctors
monopoly licencing according to the market steady state) in either
case.  As for being ""refused treatment"" the government of the day
would be shredded to tatters if something like that were to happen;
Canadians can be geographically bad, too, not realizing that their
health care is private while only their insurance isn't ... too many
people have bought into socialist trype that we have socialized
medicine.

Right, as I've pointed out above ...

>But hasn't that just shifted the locus of the problem from one place
>to the other? It hasn't really solved it.

Either way, the transient situations are hard to deal with since the
changes in the private medical care resource take place at a slower
rate than the ability of people to fall sick esp. in the light of
disasters (e.g., Chernobyl) or bad luck (a sudden wave of heart
disease). A doctor needs 4-6 years of training, plus internship 
and specialty training.

>People too often tend to put prescription cold medicine on their 
>insurance when they really don't need to.

That's why I've argued for deductible and copayments rather than
education, which is what most Canadian fiscal conservatives are
arguing for (the leftists?  ""Ah, just let 'em spend!"" --- yeah,
right!).  Also, note that only a few provinces cover prescriptions
under some high dollar threshold ... in most, it's your private
insurance that covers it just like in the U.S.  Still, it all
adds up in the OECD measures.

The medical IRA would have limited use, as you'd need a lower
catastrophic threshold else there'd still be a drain on the public
purse if someone exhausts their IRA.  Also, Singapore has a much
more autocratic mentality which has seaped down into its masses
(if Singaporeans that I've met are any indication ... I don't

Yes, many ... and pretty close to a lot of smaller towns or not too
far from a bigger town.  Just take a look at a detailed atlas ...
or better, take a flight from Pittsburgh or Rochester to Toronto.
My first time across Lake Ontario to NYC, I was amazed by the

>There was one about a group of doctors in Calgary who have opened

It's about time!  I've ragged on my own doctor friends as to why they
don't invest in their own private practices ... in the end, it's their
money.  But they choose to spend it on America's Cup pipedreams, and
that's none of my business.  As for ""provincially owned"" ... for sure
it's against the law in Canada for governments to be directly involved
in the provision of health care except in the military or native reser-
vations.  What that term actually means is that the facility gets by
on public grants to meet shortfall from *lack of use* ... no kidding.
Medical practice itself is much more conservative up north.  My own
best friend did two clerkships at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN,
and is no stranger to high tech medicine ... but his boat comes first.

>There were some people expressing concern that it was the first wedge of
>two-tiered health care and that it might violate the Canada Health Act.

No, it's probably socialist whiners who are offended that we have
private practices ... and always have.  They can all take cash
anyways ... so why not have a particular facility?  The Canadian
big government mentality often imagines government where it does
not even exist ...

Since the French and Germans have become more entrepreneurial and less
laidback without sacrificing their culture and values, then Canadians
can do the same.  As I've pointed out above, the law states that it is
illegal for the *government* to provide any health services except for
the military and natives.

Look, nobody stopped the clinic when they planned on the MRI ...
nobody stopped them when they bought it.  Nobody seems to be stopping
them from using it, either.  Much ado about nothing.  Thank goodness
that hockey playoffs have started ...

I'm certain there is exaggeration somewhere, because the GAO study
of Canada cited often on USENET did not find access to MRI to be a
problem.  I'll bet the doctor is relying on people having listened 
to American trash talk on cable so that he can puff his chest a bit.
There are already a few treatment regimens for knee injuries without
relying on MRI ... unfortunately, I've had a few. )-;  And I'm not
a banker. (-;

Eminent domain is a state-mandated transaction in which one party is
required to sell a piece of property which it owns to another party,
regardless of whether the first party wishes to sell at all, at a price
which is set by the state.  I fail to see how this doctrine can be found
in tort, bankruptcy or contract cases in general.  Well, okay, sort of
in bankruptcy...

Bang.  Here's one of the places where we widely diverge.  You believe
that the courts, in deciding a civil dispute between two parties, should
consider as a factor -- perhaps as an overriding factor -- issues which
I believe the court should ignore as being irrelevant to the dispute.
_Boomer v.  Atlantic Cement Co._ was an action brought by one party,
Boomer, whose property rights were being violated on an ongoing basis by
another party, the Atlantic Cement Company.  The facts supported
Boomer's contention that Atlantic Cement was wrongfully damaging his
property, and Boomer asked the court to order Atlantic Cement to stop
doing so.  End of story.  There was no reason for the court to consider
such issues as what a capitalistic society would want Atlantic Cement to
do or whether the cost of compliance was disproportionate to the damage
faced by the plaintiffs.  Those issues had nothing to do with the case
before the court.

I'd be up in arms?  Why do you assume that?  Quite the contrary, I'd
probably support the action, since it would be based on the same general
doctrine as the decision that I believe would have been correct in
_Boomer_: the idea that people's property rights should not be violated
for reasons of economic efficiency.  In _Boomer_ it was Boomer's
property rights which I believe the court should have protected; in the

Yes.  So what?  The courts are supposed to protect the specific rights
of individuals, not the general interests of some nebulous society.  If
society can have its cement plant without violating anyone's rights,
fine.  Otherwise society will somehow have to limp along with one less
cement plant.  (See, Ted, I really _am_ a libertarian after all! :-)

""One wants the legal regime to approximate the end result to begin with,
in order to minimize the transactions costs.""???  Which ""one"" are you
speaking of?  _I_ want the legal regime to protect people's rights.
Besides, Coase's Theorem only has real application in the never-never
land of perfectly rational actors.  In the real world (1) some people
are going to be stubborn, ornery, spiteful or otherwise ""irrational""
from a economic point of view and (2) the purpose of the courts is to
protect their right to be so.  I don't care if you can show me logically
that your cattle are only doing $100 of damage to my property per head,
so I should rationally sell you grazing rights to my land for, say, $150
per head -- I still retain the right to tell you that I just plain don't
want any damned cattle on my property, not at any price.

Last question first: For the same reason as in contract law -- because
to do so would come dangerously close to treading on the Thirteenth
Amendment.

As to your ""Then, by your argument, no tort plaintiff is ever made
whole, because the award of damages in involuntary"" claim, you're at
least partially right.  Faced with situations in which the wrong has
already been done and the damage to the victim has already taken place
and cannot be reversed or undone, courts will try to set an equitable
price tag on the loss suffered by the victim and require the wrongdoer
to pay this price (rather than an inflated price which the victim might
prefer).  In these cases, the ""sale"" has already taken place and is
irreversible, and the court simply tries to ensure that a fair price is
paid, under the doctrines that (a) only in certain circumstances should
even a civil wrongdoer be forced to pay punitive or excessive prices and
(b) even a genuine victim should not profit in an unjustified or
inequitable manner from his victimhood.  Both of these doctrines may be
worth discussing or debating elsewhere, but neither is relevant to cases
like _Boomer_ in which the wrongful act and the loss stemming from it
are still in the future and _can_ be reversed/undone (i.e., prevented
from happening at all) by order of the court.

In these types of cases, all the court has to do is require that the
potential victim's property rights are protected until and unless he
agrees to sell them at a mutually-acceptable price.  There is no need
for the court to guess at the equitable value of the loss and force both
sides to accept its finding.  It can leave that operation up to the
parties themselves.

In cases like _Boomer_, they're simply a cost of doing business.  The
fact that the proprietors of the Atlantic Cement Co. got themselves into
a position in which they found themselves over this barrel is simply a
result of their own poor business decision to start up a cement plant
without _first_ trying to negotiate with Boomer and everyone else whose
property rights they'd be violating via the operation of their plant.
There's nothing punitive or unjust about it.

Anybody who wants to commit a wrongful act in the future should be
required to buy the right to do so from the victim, in advance.  And the
seller should be allowed to set his or her price for the privilege.  No
injustice, no punitive damages.

Doesn't sound very much like a libertarian to me.  Libertarians tend to

As stated above, the tort was _ongoing_.  Atlantic Cement wanted to be
able to _continue_ to violate Boomer's rights.  While the court may have
been justified in setting an equitable price tag on the damage already
committed, it had no reason and no need to set a price tag on the
_future_ violations of Boomer's rights and to then force Boomer to sell
at that price.

""Personal gain"": for his own monetary advantage.  I don't think

It's actually quite simple. We sell Drug Use Licenses to anybody over age
18 who wants one.  Costs $100 and you're required to attend a week of
night classes on the effects of drugs on the human body. At the end of the
class, you sign an informed consent waiver acknowledging that you've been
told that drugs are bad for you, but you want them anyway. In doing so,
you giver up ANY right to state-paid medical care for whatever might
happen to you as a result of doing drugs, or any right to collect welfare
or unemployment should you lose your job as a result of using drugs. You'd
also give up your right to drive a car.  

Anybody caught using drugs without a license has a choice; pay a $1000
fine and accept a backdated drug user's license, or go to prison.

The only potential problem I see with the private MRI facilty in Calgary is the
self-referral problem to the facility for the doctors who have a financial
interest in it, which is basically unethical...but in Canada because
of our small population, there is likely only to be a few private
facilities involving only a small number of doctors,
and thus I don't think the self-referral problem, which is an epidemic in the
US, could ever get out of hand here.

What likely happened is the sponsors of the private MRI which include
doctors anticipated that Alberta would need more MRI's, and instead
of waiting for the health planners to realize they needed another
one or two, saw a business opportunity...where they would have a

You have yet to answer any or all of my questions and challenges to your

But it IS made false by your ridiculous leap of logic from ""monogamous
homosexual male sex is so rare"" (which is a load of horseshit--as
proportionately many queers are monogamous as hets, and the ones who aren't
use condoms, for the most part) to ""for practical purposes, homosexuality
spreads AIDS.""  No.  Unprotected sex with an infected partner spreads AIDS. 
These ""practical purposes"" you speak of are obviously the purposes of
spreading homophobia, which leads me to an interesting truth: ""Cramer
spreads hate.""  Isn't that nice?

You mean, ""Typical homosexual response to Clayton E. Cramer.""  I think any

But aren't you imposing your moral standards against gay people because
you do not want to rent to, or hire, or as you put associate with, (
and I do not know of a law that requires you to associate with gay
people)?  It works both ways.

All people want to have an equal opportunity for all things that
lie in the public domain.  It will be a gigantic step forward when
people take other people based upon ability and talent, rather
than skin color, eye color, height, weight, sexual orientation 
(and I use this last one as meaning gay, bi, straight, let's not
go off on the tangent about pedophiles, rapist, etc.)

I *cannot* *believe* I am posting in this thread, but what
the hell, he asked for it.

I had sort of the same reaction myself when I was first realizing
I was bi.  ""So what, >90% of everyone else is straight, I'd never
end up with a guy anyway.""  As several people on soc.bi pointed
out to me, this is true only if you find partners (for relationships
or just for sex) in primarily straight circles.  Nowadays with gay
culture quite visible in major cities and such, you can easily
find yourself in an overwhelmingly queer social circle if you so
choose.  (About half my friends are bi, and that's just from
hanging out in the science fiction club and going to UCBU once a
week, it's not as if I have to go out of my way and hang out in
bars or something.)

So the available pool for dates can be the same size.  Unless of
course you're trying to date a random sample of the US population.

As for promiscuity, I've traded email with Clayton on the topic,
and he still doesn't seem to want to admit that yes, gay males
are sometimes forced to resort to anonymous sex because they're
closeted and can't afford to be seen in a permanent relationship.
Or that part of the promiscuity is because of the messed-up gender
roles in our society, and when males are dating males and they've
*all* been trained to be the aggressor in sex, there's going to
be more sex.  Or that what's ""dysfunctional"", what's ""screwed up""
is societal attitudes, not gay sexuality, and that's what 
encourages deviant behavior in gay males.

(also note that just because someone's had 200 sex partners 
doesn't mean they're promiscuous.  yes, it sounds ridiculous,
but it's quite possible for someone to go through a heavily
closeted phase in which they have lots of anonymous sex with
strangers, and then come out, start forming real relationships,
and be monogamous or nearly so...)

Clayton, are you really an idiot, or do you just play one on USENET?

You claimed you had postings from a dozen (i.e. 12) soc.motss posters that
""supported child molestation"". (Point aside that they were really defending
abolishing or modifying the age of consent laws, or the right to be ATTRACTED
but don't act upon desires for children).

so 12 out of thousands is an ""overwhelming majority"".

You never cease to amaze me.

And you still haven't told me why my relationship with my partner is immoral.

I bought mine at the MOW storefront.
Its not plastic, its woven material.

but I think you miss the point.
its not about the five bucks in your pocket, its about supporting the
march and helping to pay for all the printed materail and scehdulkes and
organisation and...

all leading up to the literal *birth* of Queer visibility in this country.

up to this point all our news coverage has been driven by events thatb
happen to us. 
this event is happening by our direct action.
of course the last MOW was the same thing but they ignored us.
I guess that was just labor pains.
perhaps they will ignore us again, in which case we will come in
even largeer numbers next time.

Lst night in DC there were so many queers out and about you could hardly get
in any place.
I suspect thatb over the next two days that will become exponentially
larger.

To my mind this is a physical bsuting down of the collective closet of
queer invisibility.

the five bucks is insignificant.

Since 1979, the members of the European Parliament (the parliamentary assemby
of the European Community) have been elected directly by the citizens of the
Member States. Before, the Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) were just
Members of National Parliaments (MNPs) elected by and from among their peers.

In the European Parliament, every Member State has a fixed number of seats,
which increases less than proportionally with the population. Once in five
years, a general European election is being held, in which the citizens of all
Member States choose their representatives to the European Parliament. Next
elections are due in 1994.

Now the voting system for these European elections still differs from one
country to another. Although the European Treaty enabling the direct election
of the MEPs requires a uniform voting system, up to now every country has just
used its own system, more or less the same one used for national elections.
British MEPs are elected in a first-past-the-post system with one MEP per
district; nearly all other States have chosen a system with proportional
representation. But then in some countries (France, Italy) MEPs are allowed to
be a MNP as well, whilst in others they are not (Belgium, Netherlands).

The European Parliament is now working on a uniform election system for its
own members, so that every candidate should have the same regulations to
comply with, regardless of the Member State (s)he wants to be elected for. I
would like to know what you people out there think of the following questions:

1. Do you think it is necessary to have uniform regulations or should every
Member State continue to use its own regulations (for European elections that
is)?

2. Do you think a system of majority voting should be implemented, with one or
more MEPs per district, or would you prefer a system with proportional
representation (for the whole of the Community or per state, per region, per
district?).

3. Do you think the European Commission (or just its president) should be
directly elected too, or should it be appointed by the European Parliament, or
by the joint Member State governments as it is now?

4. The Maastricht Treaty allows subjects of Member States to stand for
election in another Member State they are residing in. Do you think you would
or could vote for a foreigner if his/her ideas appeal to you?

5. Do you think MEPs should be allowed to be a member of a national parliament
or a regional parliament too? Or a member of a national or regional government
body?

6. The European Parliament now has meetings in both Strasbourg and Brussels.
MEPs themselves are for a complete move to Brussels in great majority, but
political compromises between the governments of the Member States stick to
the status quo. Do you approve of this or do you think the European Parliament
should meet in one city only, and if yes, which?

Please post your answers to eunet.politics, to which all followups are
automatically directed. If you do not have access to that group, please mail
your answer directly to me and I will post it for you.

I hope many of you will take the time to post their views on this matter.

The saddest thing is that most people, like Cramer's wife, learn dislike
for homosexuality early in childhood.

Clayton, however, is so impressionable, that he let his wife sucker him

No, what it means is that I, like a majority of environmental scientists/researchers,
agree that El Nino/La Nina and the Southern Oscillations are the systems
involoved in that climatic phenomena categorized by humans as a drought(1988).

Furthermore, in response to an earlier message, the 1992 U.S. est. output of
sulfur dioxide (20 mill. tons) was equivalent to the entire output by the recent
eruption of Mt. Pinautubo(Sp.).  Currently world carbon dioxide levels set at approx.
360 ppm, in the past 120,000 years it has never gone above 280 (this info
was found using ice core samples from the joint French/Russian/U.S. Vostok
project).  Furthermore,  the background emmisions of chlorine compounds into
the atmoshpere is about 0.6 ppb annually, it now sits at 3.5.  This OVERWHELMING
data/info is found in the World Resources doc. published by Oxford University.

The ozone hole in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres keeps getting bigger
and stickin' around longer whilst skeptics ponder how wrong or corrupt all this
data from government and international scientific institutions is.  It is a pity, that,
if the skeptics are wrong and we base our complacency on their Limbaugh
psycho babble, then we will find ourselves strapped by limited options with
which to rectify the primal engineering of our industrial age.

What a JOKE! You can't actually believe what you just said. Can you? We 
bombed and invaded these countries.

Notice the definition of war (from the American Heritage Dictionary):
	1) A state or period of armed conflict between nations or states.
This qualifies the invasions of Cambodia and Laos as wars.

A search for illegally held weapons (IF there were any, no evidence yet
produced to this effect) does not justify firing into a house with
women and children, either. It also does not justify shooting first
without identifying oneself (the ATF and FBI have done this before, so
don't say they haven't, please) or producing a warrant.

Guess it depends on whose story one believes, huh?

Evidence? So far the FBI has produced none. Don't hold your breath.

It was not the Feds decision to make, but the firefighters.

This is true of ANY answer to a call for help from a fire department by
ANY citizen. Since fire departments do answer calls that ""deprive 
resources that might be needed elsewhere"" it is not a valid reason for
not calling them.

Further, since the Davidians had not been found guilty of any crime in
a court of law, they are subject to the same protection as any other
citizen. And las far as I know, even criminals in prison are not left to 
burn to death in a fire.

I guess this is a matter of religious faith with you? The government
says it, so it must be so? Or haven't you been reading this thread well 
enough to notice that some of us here don't beleive their story?

Patients in psychiatric hospitals are not left to die in fires, either.
Besides, as I explained, some of us here believe their distress might
have been genuine. Are you SO certain it wasn't?

There is no evidence that the Davidians committed human sacrifice 
either before of after the initial raid. And self-defense is not
murder.

He did not say it was deliberate. Accidents do not require conspiracy
theories, only wanton disregard for human life. The initial raid alone
(agents firing blind into walls against all standards of law enforce-

No one here is ""supporting Koresh"". We are opposing the illegal use of
excessive violence by our government against our citizens. That is all.

A society that believes it is OK to terrorize people for their religious
views will destroy itself in due time. It is the feds who disrupted the
""fabric of society"" in Waco, not Koresh. It is the feds who forced a
nightmare onto the people of Mount Carmel.

""It would be a good thing if people drew the same conclusions from
history that I do?"" :-)

""Militant"" implies acts of aggression against one's neighbors. The
Davidians left their neighbors alone.

So what? The Mormons were considered a ""cult"" for years, and were chased
out of one place after another on much the same thinking as you are
advocating. When they finally got to ""set up a community"" they left
people alone. So far Americans haven't been put to the sword by Mormon
hordes crying to avenge Joseph Smith. :-)

>Just because a group of people start by saying that all they want is to be

It doesn't mean they won't either. Anyway, the whole purpose of a 
system of laws is to punish people for what they DO, not what they
MIGHT do.

""Telling"" is not the same as ""forcing"". When the police knock at my
door, I cannot make them go away by changing the channeI. As for Pat
and friends, I don't even WATCH their channel, since I am an atheist.
So far, not watching them tell me what to do hasn't gotten me killed :-)

Right now, the only people sticking guns in anyone's faces is the

Not quite.  First, the median does not imply that half of the men are

likely zero).  However, assuming your implication to be more-or-less
correct, your final result is still invalid.  If 50% of *all* males

It's my observation that women are more likely to me more strongly

Also there are definite double standards for men and women who are
promiscuous.

Could there also be a factor of communication being more direct in 
homosexual relationships and culture.

The original poster never said they were afraid of King because he was
black.  In fact the officers were afraid of King because of WHAT HE DID,
not because OF THE COLOR OF HIS SKIN.  It is you, Mr. Frank that read the
phrase ""large black man"" and cried racism in a typical knee-jerk fashion.
When you (and others, I suspect) can get past this problem maybe the real
problems in this issue can be discussed.

Just out of curiosity, what else was there to do in this situation?
Wait another 51 days/weeks/months/years???

Was there anything indicating that these children and the other
people were going to get out alive?

                            PRESS BRIEFING
                           BY DEE DEE MYERS


                          The Briefing Room


10:35 A.M. EDT
	     
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  At 1:00 p.m., we're having a press 
conference, Bill, in the East Room.  And then Saturday the President 
will leave here at roughly 8:00 a.m. and fly down to Jamestown.  He 
will spend the day there, overnight at Camp David. 
	     
	     On Sunday, it's unclear exactly what time he'll leave 
Camp David and fly to Boston.  He'll leave from Hagerstown. The press 
plane will leave from Washington. 
	     
	     He will meet with some --
	     
	     Q	  What kind of a plane is that he's taking?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  That he's taking?  He'll probably take a C-
20.
	     
	     Q	  From Hagerstown?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  From Hagerstown.  Air Force One doesn't fly 
out of Hagerstown, apparently.
	     
	     Q	  How will the pool travel?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  The pool will have to meet him ahead of 
time.  So I guess the pool will travel with the press plane and wait 
for him at the airport.  There is currently no provision -- and I'll 
double-check, because there's currently no provision -- I think 
that's standard operating practice.
	     
	     Q	  The pool is not going to meet him and watch him get 
on the plane at Hagerstown?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.
	     
	     Q	  What time does he have to be in Boston?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  He's going to meet there with a group of 
citizens, mostly people who supported us during the campaign, at 
around 1:30 p.m.  We're still working out the final times.
	     
	     Q	  At the airport?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No, it will be at the Boston Harbor Hotel.  
	     And then he will also meet with some -- a youth group 
that authored something called Project 21.  The speech to the 
publishers is actually at 3:15 p.m.  It will be followed by Q&A.  And 
then after the speech and Q&A, he'll attend a reception with the 
publishers, and then return to Washington from Boston.  And that's it 
for the weekend.
	     
	     Q	  Has the President seen the report from -- or the 
letter, communication from the foreign service officers; also, 
obviously, the communication from Madeleine Albright?  And what is 
his reaction to their call on him?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Well, obviously, the letter was written to 
Secretary Christopher.  I believe Secretary Christopher received the 
letter on Saturday.  He reviewed it and met with the authors on 
Monday to discuss their views.  He believes it's an important part of 
the policy-making process and is taking their views into account as 
we go forward in the development of the Bosnia policy.
	     
	     Q	  What is the President's reaction?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  The President hasn't seen the letter.  It 
was something that was directed towards Secretary Christopher.  In 
terms of -- he hasn't seen specifically the letter, but in terms of 
their concerns generally, what the President has said is that there 
are a lot of options on the table now, including ones that weren't 
there before.  And I think he's, as is everybody, gravely concerned 
about the situation in Bosnia.
	     
	     Q	  Is he influenced by that?  I mean, how does he feel 
about the fact that all of the specialists in that area -- those desk 
officers --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Many of the specialists in that area -- I 
think that that is clearly part of the process.  It's something -- 
their views will clearly be considered.  I think Secretary 
Christopher met with the group immediately to discuss their views.  I 
think he believes that there ought to be room for opinions and that 
those opinions ought to be considered, particularly from people who 
work closely on the issues.
	     
	     Q	  What do you mean, there are options on the table 
that weren't there before?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think the President said last week that 
there were options, such as lifting the arms embargo to the Bosnian 
Muslims, that had been previously off the table that are now being 
considered.
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee, in terms of those options, Madeleine 
Albright is saying that potentially there could be unilateral action 
by the U.S. if the Europeans did not go along.  Is that on the table?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Well, I can't discuss anything that would -- 
any conversations that would have happened between Ambassador 
Albright and the President.  But I think the President has said he 
would certainly -- is working with our European allies.  He's had a 
number of conversations with European leaders and is trying to build 
some consensus there.  
	     
	     Q	  Will he reach a decision -- will he have anything 
specific to say today?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No.  I mean, in term of there will be no new 
announcement of policy today.
	     
	     Q	  Does your statement mean he has ruled out 
unilateral action?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  He's continuing to consult with our allies 
at this point.  He has said -- I think he's been fairly clear about 
it, that the he believes that the U.S. needs to act in concert with 
its allies on this.
	     
	     Q	  On that point, does he believe that the U.S., 
though, does have built-in authority from the United Nations already 
to take unilateral action?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Well, I think the U.N. Resolution 770 makes 
it clear that you can act unilaterally in support of any humanitarian 
relief effort.  I think the broader point is that anything we do, any 
options that we decide to pursue we will make sure that it is 
consistent with U.N. authority, and if it's not, we'll work with our 
allies to make sure that we get it.
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee, then how does the White House someone as 
distinguished as Elie Wiesel, who says that not enough is being done 
to stop the atrocities going on in Bosnia?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think that that's why we're considering 
additional options.  I think that Mr. Wiesel's comments yesterday 
were quite compelling.  The situation in Bosnia is tragic.  The 
President is very concerned about it.  He has -- I think President 
Clinton has worked very hard  to take further actions to continue to 
isolate Serbia in the world community.  Clearly, we're considering 
other options because the President is concerned that perhaps it's 
not enough.
	     
	     Q	  In terms of what you were just talking about, it 
sounds like Resolution 770 justifies unilateral action by the U.S. to 
protect humanitarian --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't think it -- I wouldn't use the word 
justify.  It permits unilateral action by any country in protecting 
the delivery of humanitarian relief.  But I think that's just an 
explanation of the resolution.  I think any action that we take will 
be consistent with U.N. resolutions or we'll work with our allies to 
make sure that it is permissible or we'll get further action.
	     
	     Q	  The President and other officials have ruled out 
unilateral U.S. action in Bosnia in the past.  You're declining to do 
that this morning.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No, I said the President has said repeatedly 
that he wants to act in concert with our allies on this.
	     
	     Q	  That doesn't mean that he won't act alone, which 
has been said before explicitly.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't mean to imply a change in policy.  
The President has said all along that he wants to act in concert with 
our allies on this.
	     
	     Q	  One other little question.  Did he know about this 
letter from the foreign service officers before it hit the papers?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  Secretary Christopher 
-- they may have had a private conversation about it.  The President 
has not seen it.
	     
	     Q	  They met on Monday, right?  Christopher met --
surely, he must have brought that up --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Again, they may have talked privately about 
it, but --
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee, what you're saying is that the Albright 
recommendation has been rejected, is that correct?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No, I didn't say that at all.  I said I 
won't -- I said I wouldn't comment on any conversations or 
communications.
	     
	     Q	  She's advocating unilateral action and you're 
saying, in effect, that we will not take unilateral action.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I am not confirming anything that Madeleine 
Albright may or may not have recommended.
	     
	     Q	  Given the sometimes delicate, complicated and 
frustrating nature of negotiations with the allies on this issue, 
does the President find this kind of letter from 12 foreign service 
officers of the State Department helpful to that process, hurtful to 
that?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think that their views are obviously being 
considered.  The Secretary received that memo on Saturday and two 
days later he met with them in order to have a more thorough airing 
of their views, of the basis for their views, to discuss in greater 
detail the options that they had presented in the letter.
	     
	     Q	  Doesn't it put some kind of pressure on --
additional pressure on him now from within his own administration to 
act regardless of what the allies may or may not do?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think clearly there's a broad policy 
review underway now.  And the President and his advisors are 
considering a number of options, including some of those outlined in 
the letter from the folks over at the State Department.  Now, no 
decisions have been made on that yet, but I think that there is a 
through review underway, and that their opinions are being very 
seriously considered.
	     
	     Q	  If I can just follow up, I guess what I'm looking 
for is what was his reaction to this letter?  Did he say, good, this 
bolsters my position?  Or did he say, damn, this is just what I don't 
need right now?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think he said this helps contribute 
substantively to the debate.  It's important that all views be 
considered and aired thoroughly, that before he makes a decision he 
wants to have the best possible advice and information possible, and 
this, I think in many ways, furthers that goal.
	     
	     Q	  So internal advice to a Cabinet official or the 
President -- it's all open now, and you wouldn't take any umbrage or 
say that they were out of line?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think that the fact that Secretary 
Christopher met with them to discuss their views and make sure they 
had an opportunity to have a more complete conversation about it is 
conclusive evidence that their views are welcome.
	     
	     Q	  Does the policy review include what Madeleine 
Albright has suggested, and what Joe Biden and others have suggested, 
which is that the previous U.N. resolutions authorize unilateral 
action -- military action -- for the delivery of humanitarian --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think all options are on the table.
	     
	     Q	  The unilateral option is on the table?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think all options are on the table.
	     
	     Q	  We've had two different --
	     
	     Q	  Isn't that a change, Dee Dee?
	     
	     Q	  That would be a change of policy.
	     
	     Q	  Particularly if it includes ground troops, which 
has been specifically ruled out.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think the President has been -- well, no.  
I don't -- that is not --
	     
	     Q	  Are you talking about all options?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  All options -- I think the President has 
been fairly clear about that.  So let me just review again what he 
has said.  He has said that -- the President has said all options are 
on the table, with the exception of the introduction of ground 
troops, which he has never suggested.  He has ruled that out from the 
beginning.
	     
	     Q	  Hasn't he ruled out unilateral action of any sort?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  He has said that he doesn't believe the U.S. 
can solve the problems in the former Yugoslavia by itself.  I think 
that there are a number of very complicated options on the table 
right now.  I don't think that -- again, I don't want to comment on 
specific options that are being considered other than in the broad 
categories that we've already said -- things like lifting the arms 
embargo against the Bosnian Muslims, things that I think we've talked 
about in broad terms.  This is a very complicated situation.  The 
options being presented and considered are very complicated.
	     
	     Q	  Air strikes on the table?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Again, I think that's been fairly clearly 
pointed out that that's something that's being discussed.
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee, are ground troops on the -- 
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No, ground troops are not being considered.
	     
	     Q	  You said there was not going to be -- you said you 
were not announcing a change of policy.  Then you said everything is 
on the table.  We're confused.  Are unilateral actions on the table?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  All I can tell you is what the President has 
said -- that he doesn't believe -- that he wants to act in concert 
with the allies on this.
	     
	     Q	  Wants to, but he's willing to -- I mean, if they 
don't go along --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  He's continuing to consult with our allies 
on this.  He's continuing to have discussions.  He's continuing to 
press them for further action.  And I think that's clear.  The 
conversation is ongoing.  We're going to continue to work with them 
to find the best possible solution and next step on this.
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee, the allies have taken the position that to 
conduct any kind of air strikes in Bosnia would have the opposite 
effect of ensuring the delivery of humanitarian aid; that they feel 
that their troops on the ground monitoring the delivery of that aid 
would become vulnerable and the Bosnians --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I'm not sure that's the consistent -- I 
mean, I'm not sure who you're referring to.
	     
	     Q	  The British and the French.
	     
	     Q	  Yes, the British and French.  They've taken the 
position that the delivery of humanitarian aid would be jeopardized 
by any kind of air strikes against the Bosnian military.  Does the 
U.S. believe differently from that?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  The President has had conversations with 
both Mitterrand and Major, as you know.  I think that there is a 
thorough review of policy going on in those countries as well.  And I 
don't want to comment on the nature of the President's discussions 
other than to say that he's continuing to consult with our allies as 
we move forward and he's continuing to press them for further action.  
And I think that process is ongoing.
	     
	     Q	     the other day voted against any military 
intervention yesterday.  Does the President regard that as the end of 
the line or does he does still hold out some possibility of 
unilateral action?  The allies have been very, very plain that they 
do not want to do anything.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  The consultations are ongoing.  That's all I 
can tell you at this point.
	     
	     Q	  Are you saying that there won't be any announcement 
on Bosnia today in the press conference?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No, that is not the intention of the press 
conference.
	     
	     Q	  What is the intention?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  It's an opportunity to take questions.  He 
may have a brief -- I'm sure he'll have a brief opening statement, 
but it is not an opportunity to outline a new policy on Bosnia.  That 
will not happen.
	     
	     Q	  Can you tell us what the subject of the opening 
statement is?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  It's sort of a general statement of where we 
are.
	     
	     Q	  After the first hundred days, you mean?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  It's not a long statement.  I mean, this is 
just generally.  Don't look for any major policy pronouncements.
	     
	     Q	  Do you know what the opening statement is?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  But it's -- perhaps later today I'll be able 
to tell you with more certainty -- I think that's still under review.  
But the overriding purpose of this -- it's not a mystery; it's not 
meant to be.  It's just to take questions.
	     
	     Q	  It would be helpful to know whether -- what the 
opening statement is on.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Since the major purpose here is just to take 
questions, it's not completely resolved yet.
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee, one policy that was expected last week and 
that the White House, you and George seemed to indicate we might get, 
would be an AIDS czar.  Will he announce that today?  And what's the 
delay on that?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't think we meant to imply -- I think 
we said it would happen soon.  I don't think we meant to imply with 
any certainty that it would be this week.  It is coming soon.  I 
don't anticipate that happening today.
	     
	     Q	  What's the delay?  Isn't this the perfect time to 
announce an AIDS czar?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't know that it's a delay.  I think the 
process is ongoing to find the best possible person and to go through 
the necessary background checks, and to make sure that we've crossed 
the t's and dotted the i's before we make an announcement.
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee, what are Zoe Baird's qualifications for 
the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board?  And why wasn't her 
appointment announced here?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  The qualifications -- I don't know if 
there's a specific list; I'll have to check and see.  I think there 
are a number of people there on the board with different backgrounds.  
Many of them have long histories in intelligence or other government 
service.  I think there's a broad variety of views across political 
spectrum and across backgrounds that are represented there.  We never 
made a formal announcement other than the Chairman of the Board, 
which is Admiral William Crowe.
	     
	     Q	  Why would he appoint her, though, if the American 
people and many in the Senate rejected her for another government 
job?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe that the American people 
ever had -- voted on her.  And I certainly -- she was never rejected 
in the Senate.  She never went up there for a hearing.  But the 
President believes she's a very competent person.  He's said that -- 
Zoe Baird -- do you understand what the question is?  Zoe Baird is on 
the President's Foreign Intelligence --
	     
	     Q	  You said she never went up there for a hearing?
	     
	     Q	  Her nomination was withdrawn after public outrage 
over violating federal laws?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Right, she never -- she was never -- but you 
said she was rejected by the Senate.  I was just simply trying to 
point out that she was never voted on by the Senate.
	     
	     Q	  So you don't think that is any problem?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't think there's any problem.
	     
	     Q	  She has been appointed to this board, is that a 
fact?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Yes.
	     
	     Q	  Does she need confirmation for this?  Does she need 
confirmation to be a member of the --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No.  It's a presidential appointment.
	     
	     Q	  Usually, announcements are made here at the White 
House.  Was there a decision not to announce her publicly?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  We didn't make an announcement.  People who 
asked were told who  the members of the board were.  We didn't make 
an official announcement.  If anybody's interested in that we can 
certainly put out the list of names.
	     
	     Q	  I'd like to know.
	     
	     Q	  Don't such board members -- don't you normally as a  
matter of -- routinely put out releases on all these boards and 
presidential appointment regardless of their dimension?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Not always.  But, again, I'm happy to put 
this out.
	     
	     Q	  Isn't that the standard practice?
	     
	     Q	  That was past practice.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Again, I'm happy to put it out.  We'll put 
out a list of the members of the board today.
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee, I don't want to try to fail to let you get 
out of this swamp but -- (laughter) -- all I really want to know is 
hasn't it been the practice in this administration for such 
announcements to be made routinely?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think generally but not always.  And we're 
happy to put that out today.
	     
	     Q	  What is the board, what is her title, what is the 
size of the board?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  There is roughly a dozen members on the 
board.  It is a civilian board, although their are some, obviously, 
retired military personnel on the board that provide input into 
intelligence policy for the President.  Again, the chairman of that 
board is Admiral William Crowe.
	     
	     Q	  And did he recommend Baird?
	     
	     Q	  What's the name of the board?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  It's the President's Foreign Intelligence 
Advisory Board, PFIAB.
	     
	     Q	  What's her qualification -- that she had employed 
an illegal alien?  Is that -- (laughter) -- 
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Do you want an answer to the question or you 
just want to make a joke?
	     
	     Q	  Let me phrase it another way.  Why shouldn't this 
appointment be viewed as a pay-back for the difficulty she had a 
couple of months ago?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Because it's not.  
	     
	     Q	  What's her experience in foreign intelligence?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  She's an experienced attorney, someone who 
the President believes is very competent and qualified.  And I think 
part of the mission of this board is to provide civilian input.  Not 
everybody on the board is supposed to be an intelligence expert; that 
is not the board's mission.  It is to provide civilian input for the 
President as he makes decisions regarding intelligence matters.  He 
believes she's very qualified, very competent person, enormously 
talented and has said that throughout.
	     
	     Q	  Is this just a figment of my overactive 
imagination, or was there discussion early on about abolishing the 
President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't think so.  On December 24th, when he 
announced all of his foreign policy advisors he announced that he 
would -- had appointed Admiral Crowe as the head of the board.  So I 
don't believe there's ever been any --
	     
	     Q	  Earlier than that, during the transition.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No, I don't believe so.  It was announced, 
again, on December 24th.  Admiral Crowe couldn't be there, but it was 
announced. 
	     
	     Q	  Are members paid?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so, but I'll double-check.
	     
	     Q	  On another subject, on Waco, how do you explain the 
discrepancy between the federal reports of the autopsies of the 
bodies that are coming out of Waco and the state?  I guess it's the 
Texas Ranger reports.  
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Most of the information is coming -- the 
federal information is coming from the site.  Clearly, there's been 
some discrepancies and the Justice Department is looking into it.  
Officials in the Justice Department were told, I believe the day 
before yesterday, that there were several bodies found with bullet 
holes.  I think there's some discrepancy about that, and the Justice 
Department is looking into it.
	     
	     Q	  Is the President going to get involved in trying to 
sort out what seems to be becoming a jurisdictional morass down 
there, with some people withdrawing, others saying they're in charge, 
but others -- Justice, FBI, Texas Rangers -- all grabbing a piece of 
this?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't know that he's going to try to 
mediate the dispute.  I mean, I'll let you know if there's anything 
he intends to do about it.  But as you know, there are several levels 
of investigation ongoing, and we're hopeful that they can work 
together. 
	     
	     Q	  Is there any one agency or official down there in 
charge of everything?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't know.  I'll have to get back to you 
on that.
	     
	     Q	  What is the subject matter of Sunday's speech?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  It's going to be fairly general.  I don't 
think it's going to be any specific announcements.  I think it's 
going to be sort of a --
	     
	     Q	  Does he have a topic that he's going to talk about?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  We're still working on it.  But I wouldn't 
look for any announcements of, like, the drug czar or something like 
that.
	     
	     Q	  Is it sort of a 100 days speech, sort of ""my 
excellent adventure for 100 days""?  (Laughter.)
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Not exactly, but I think he'll take a little 
bit broader look about what's happened in the last --
	     
	     Q	  Foreign, domestic?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  A little bit of both, but I think a lot of 
domestic.
	     
	     Q	  And overview. 
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Yes, more of an overview than a specific 
policy announcement.  
	     	  
	     Q	  Has there been an agreement yet on a forum by which 
the President will address the gay rights march on Sunday?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  It will be a letter read to the crowd by 
Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi.
	     
	     Q	  Is that available?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Not yet, but it will be.  Sure.
	     
	     Q	  Are you going to put it out here or --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  We'll probably put it out here on Sunday.
	     
	     Q	  Travel next week?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Unclear.
	     
	     Q	  What was the question?
	     
	     Q	  Likely?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't --
	     
	     Q	  Likely?  Possible?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Possible.
	     
	     Q	  What's possible?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Travel.
	     
	     Q	  George mentioned yesterday campaign finance reform 
and national service legislative proposals next week.  Do you have 
days yet for them?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Not yet.
	     
	     Q	  Can you tell us which order?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Campaign finance reform first; national 
service later in the week.
	     
	     Q	  Is there any coverage tomorrow in Williamsburg?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No.
	     
	     Q	  And any report in the aftermath of the day?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Any readout from the day?
	     
	     Q	  Readout.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  It's possible.  Jeff Eller will be down 
there.  I think he can go through what the President did during the 
day.  We don't expect any photo op or anything, other than departure 
here in the morning.
	     
	     Q	   Dee Dee, the President has not made a regular 
practice, as some of his predecessors have, of going to Camp David.  
In fact, he's been there -- what -- once or twice?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Twice.
	     
	     Q	  Why this weekend?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  He went two weekends ago, as you know, on 
the way home from his father-in-law's funeral.  I think that they 
found it to be a good experience and a nice way for them to spend 
some time together as a family.  And this is just an opportunity to 
do the same.
	     
	     Q	  There's no march there.
	     
	     Q	  It has nothing to do with the march here?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No.
	     
	     Q	  Since he's going to be in town Sunday morning now 
instead of in Jamestown, have you thought about him making a quick 
pass-by, fly-over -- (laughter) --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  He'll fly straight to Boston.
	     
	     Q	  Flying straight did you say?  (Laughter.)
	     
	     Q	  George took a question yesterday on Waco.  The 
President had said on Tuesday in the Rose Garden that there was a 
minor disagreement on tactics between the military advisors and the 
FBI.  And the question was whether you knew exactly what that was and 
whether it related to the use of the particular kind of tear gas.  Do 
you have an answer on that?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't.  I'll check.
	     
	     THE PRESS:  Thank you.

Do we know yet who will be holding the hearings? And, if so, do
we know who is on the committee of question askers? I'm sure
many of us have potential questions we'd like to send to them.

                  PRESS CONFERENCE BY THE PRESIDENT
	     
	     
                            The East Room 


1:00 P.M. EDT
	     
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Terry, do you have a question?
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, there's a growing feeling that the 
Western response to bloodshed in Bosnia has been woefully inadequate.  
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel asked you yesterday to do something, 
anything to stop the fighting.  Is the United States considering 
taking unilateral action such as air strikes against Serb artillery 
sites?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first let me say, as you know, for 
more than a week now we have been seriously reviewing our options for 
further action.  And I want to say, too, let's look at the last three 
months.  Since I became President I have worked with our allies and 
we have tried to move forward, first on the no-fly zone, on 
enforcement of it, on the humanitarian airdrops, on the war crimes 
investigation, on getting the Bosnian Muslims involved in the peace 
process.  We have made some progress.  And now we have a very much 
tougher sanctions resolution.  And Leon Fuerth, who is the National 
Security Advisor to the Vice President, is in Europe now working on 
implementing that.  That is going to make a big difference to Serbia.
	     
	     And we are reviewing other options.  I think we should 
act.  We should lead -- the United States should lead.  We have led 
for the last three months.  We have moved the coalition.  And to be 
fair, our allies in Europe have been willing to do their part.  And 
they have troops on the ground there.
	     
	     But I do not think we should act alone, unilaterally, 
nor do I think we will have to.  And in the next several days I think 
we will finalize the extensive review which has been going on and 
which has taken a lot of my time, as well as the time of the 
administration, as it should have, over the last 10 days or so.  I 
think we'll finish that in the near future and then we'll have a 
policy and we'll announce it and everybody can evaluate it.
	     
	     Q	  Can I follow up?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Sure.
	     
	     Q	  Do you see any parallel between the ethnic 
cleansing in Bosnia and the Holocaust?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I think the Holocaust is on a whole 
different level.  I think it is without precedent or peer in human 
history.  On the other hand, ethnic cleansing is the kind of 
inhumanity that the Holocaust took to the nth degree.  The idea of 
moving people around and abusing them and often killing them solely 
because of their ethnicity is an abhorrent thing.  And it is 
especially troublesome in that area where people of different ethnic 
groups live side by side for so long together.  And I think you have 
to stand up against it.  I think it's wrong.
	     
	     We were talking today about all of the other troubles in 
that region.  I was happy to see the violence between the Croats and 
the Muslims in Bosnia subside this morning, and I think we're making 
progress on that front.  But what's going on with the Serbians and 
the ethnic cleansing is qualitatively different than the other 
conflicts, both within the former Yugoslavia and in other parts of 
the region.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, by any count, you have not had a 
good week in your presidency.  The tragedy in Waco, the defeat of 
your stimulus bill, the standoff in Bosnia.  What did you do wrong 
and what are you going to do differently?  How do you look at things?  
Are you reassessing?  (Laughter.)
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't really believe that the 
situation in Bosnia -- it's not been a good week for the world, but I 
don't know that the administration could have made it different.
	     
	     On the stimulus package, I'd like to put it into the 
larger context and remind you that in this 100 days we have already 
fundamentally changed the direction of an American government.  We 
have abandoned trickle-down economics.  We've abandoned the policies 
that brought the debt of this country from $1 trillion to $4 trillion 
in only a decade.  
	     
	     The budget plan, which passed the Congress, which will 
reduce the deficit and increase investment, has led to a 20-year low 
in mortgage rates, dramatically lower interest rates.  There are 
probably people in this room who have refinanced their home mortgages 
in the last three months, or who have had access to cheaper credit.  
That's going to put tens of billion dollars coursing throughout this 
economy in ways that are very, very good for the country.  And so we 
are moving in the right direction economically.
	     
	     I regret that the stimulus did not pass, and I have 
begun to ask -- and will continue to ask not only people in the 
administration, but people in the Congress whether there is something 
I could have done differently to pass that.  Part of the reason it 
didn't pass was politics; part of it was a difference in ideas.  
There are really people still who believe that it's not needed.  I 
just disagree with that.  
	     
	     I think the recovery -- the economists say it's been 
underway for about two years, and we've still had 16 months of seven-
percent unemployment, and all the wealthy countries are having 
trouble creating jobs.  So I think there was an idea base -- an 
argument there, that while we're waiting for the lower interest rates 
and the deficit reduction and the investments of the next four years 
to take effect, this sort of supplemental appropriation should go 
forward.
	     
	     Now, I have to tell you, I did misgauge that because a 
majority of the Republican senators now sitting in the Senate voted 
for a similar stimulus when Ronald Reagan was President in 1983, and 
voted 28 times for regular supplemental appropriations like this.  I 
just misgauged it.  And I hope that I can learn something.  I've just 
been here 90 days.  And, you know, I was a Governor working with a 
contentious legislature for 12 years, and it took me a decade to get 
political reform there.  So it takes time  to change things.  But I 
basically feel very good about what's happened in the first 100 days 
with regard to the Congress.
	     
	     Q	  Waco --
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, with regard to Waco I don't have 
much to add to what I've already said.  I think it is a -- I want the 
situation looked into.  I want us to bring in people who have any 
insights to bear on that.  I think it's very important that the whole 
thing be thoroughly gone over.  But I still maintain what I said from 
the beginning, that the offender there was David Koresh.  And I do 
not think the United States government is responsible for the fact 
that a bunch of fanatics decided to kill themselves.  And I'm sorry 
that they killed their children.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, to follow up partly on Helen on your 
stimulus package and on your political approach to Capitol Hill, Ross 
Perot said today that you're playing games with the American people 
in your tax policy.  He was strongly critical of your stimulus 
package.  He said he's going to launch an advertising campaign 
against the North American Free Trade Agreement.  How are you going 
to handle his political criticism?  Will it complicate your efforts 
on the Hill with your economic plan?  And do you plan to repackage 
some of the things that have been in your stimulus program and try to 
resubmit them to the Hill?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me answer that question first.  
We're going to revisit all of that over the next few days.  I'm going 
to be talking to members of Congress and to others to see what we can 
do about that.  With regard to the economic plan, I must say I found 
that rather amazing.  I don't want to get into an argument with Mr. 
Perot.  I'll be interested to hear what his specifics are, but I 
would -- go back and read his book and his plan.  There's a 
remarkable convergence except that we have more specific budget cuts, 
we raise taxes less on the middle class and more on the wealthy.  
But, otherwise, the plans are remarkably similar.  
	     
	     So I think it would be -- I'll be interested to see if 
maybe perhaps he's changed his position from his book last year and 
he has some new ideas to bring to bear.  I'll be glad to hear them.
	     
	     Q	  To follow up, sir, how do you plan to handle his 
political criticism?  He's launched a campaign against you.  Do you 
think you can sit back and just --
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I will ask you to 
apply the same level of scrutiny to him as you do to me.  And if he's 
changed his position from the positions he took in the campaign last 
year, then we need to know why and what his ideas are.  Maybe he's 
got some constructive ideas.  
	     
	     I think the American people have shown that they're very 
impatient with people who don't want to produce results.  And the one 
thing I think that everybody has figured out about me in the last -- 
even if they don't agree with what I do -- is that I want to get 
something done.  I just came here to try to change things.  I want to 
do things.  And I want to do things that help people's lives.  So my 
judgment is that if he makes a suggestion that is good, that is 
constructive, that takes us beyond some idea I've proposed that will 
change people's lives for the better, fine.  But I think that that 
ought to be the test that we apply to everyone who weighs into this 
debate and not just to the President.

	     Q	  Mr. President, to go back to Bosnia for a minute.  
You continue to insist that this has to be multilateral action, a 
criteria that seems to have hamstrung us when it comes to many 
options thus far and makes it look as if this is a state of 
paralysis.  The United States is the last remaining superpower.  Why 
is it not appropriate in this situation for the United States to act 
unilaterally?

	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, the United States -- surely you 
would agree, that the United States, even as the last remaining 
superpower, has to act consistent with international law under some 
mandate of the United Nations.

	     Q	  But you have a mandate and --

	     THE PRESIDENT:  They do, and that is one of the things 
that we have under review.  I haven't ruled out any option for 
action.  I would remind all of you, I have not ruled out any option, 
except that we have not discussed and we are not considering the 
introduction of American forces into continuing hostilities there.  
We are not.  

	     So we are reviewing other options.  But I also would 
remind you that, to be fair, our allies have had -- the French, the 
British and the Canadians -- have had troops on the ground there.  
They have been justifiably worried about those.  But they have 
supported the airdrops, the toughening of the sanctions.  They 
welcomed the American delegation now in Europe, working on how to 
make these sanctions really work and really bite against Serbia.  And 
I can tell you that the other nations involved are also genuinely 
reassessing their position, and I would not rule out the fact that we 
can reach an agreement for a concerted action that goes beyond where 
we have been.  I don't have any criticism of the British, the French 
and others about that.
	     
	     Q	  Would that be military action?
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, several of the leading lights in 
your administration, ranging from your FBI Director to your U.N. 
Ambassador, to your Deputy Budget Director to your Health Services 
Secretary, have issued statements in the last couple of weeks which 
are absolutely contradictory to some of the positions you've taken in 
your administration.  Why is that?  Are you losing your political 
grip?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Give me an example. 
	     
	     Q	  Example?  Judge Sessions said that there was no 
child abuse in Waco.  Madeleine Albright has said in this morning's 
newspapers, at least, that she favors air strikes in Bosnia.  All of 
these are things you said that you didn't support.
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  First of all, I don't know what -- we 
know that David Koresh had sex with children.  I think that is 
undisputed, is it not?  Is it not?  Does anybody dispute that?  Where 
I come from that qualifies as child abuse.  And we know that he had 
people teaching these kids how to kill themselves.  I think that 
qualifies as abuse.  And I'm not criticizing Judge Sessions because I 
don't know exactly what he said.
	     
	     In terms of Madeleine Albright, Madeleine Albright has 
made no public statement at all about air strikes.  There is a press 
report that she wrote me a confidential letter in which she expressed 
her -- or memo -- in which she expressed her views about the new 
direction we should take in response to my request to all the senior 
members of my administration to let me know what they thought we 
ought to do next.  And I have heard from her and from others about 
what they think we ought to do next.  And I'm not going to discuss 
the recommendations they made to me, but in the next few days when I 
make a decision about what to do, then I will announce what I'm going 
to do.  So I wouldn't say that either one of those examples qualifies 
speaking out of school.
	     
	     Q	  How about the Value Added Tax, Mr. President?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  What was that?
	     
	     Q	  The Value Added Tax -- Mrs. Rivlin and Miss Shalala 
both said that they thought that that was a good idea.
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't mind them saying they think it's 
a good idea.  There are all kinds of arguments for it on policy 
grounds.  That does not mean that we have decided to incorporate it 
in the health care debate.  No decision has been made on that.  And I 
have no objection to their expressing their views on that.  We've had 
a lot of people from business and labor come to us saying that they 
thought that tax would help make their particular industries more 
competitive in the global economy.  I took no -- that wasn't taking a 
line against an administration policy.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, a week ago a group of gay and 
lesbian representatives came out of a meeting with you and expressed 
in the most ringing terms, their confidence in your understanding of 
them and their political aspirations, and their belief that you would 
fulfill those aspirations.  Do you feel now that you will be able to 
meet their now enhanced expectations?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I don't know about that.  And I 
don't know what their -- it depends on what the expectations are.  
But I'll tell you this:  I believe that this country's policies 
should be heavily biased in favor of nondiscrimination.  I believe 
when you tell people they can't do certain things in this country 
that other people can do, there ought to be an overwhelming and 
compelling reason for it.  I believe we need the services of all of 
our people, and I have said that consistently.  And not as a 
political proposition.  The first time this issue came up was in 1991 
when I was in Boston.  I was just asked the question about it.
	     
	     And I might add -- it's interesting that I have been 
attacked -- obviously, those who disagree with me here are primarily 
coming from the political right in America.  When I was Governor, I 
was attacked from the other direction for sticking up for the rights 
of religious fundamentalists to run their child care centers and to 
practice home schooling under appropriate safeguards.  I just have 
always had an almost libertarian view that we should try to protect 
the rights of American individual citizens to live up to the fullest 
of their capacities, and I'm going to stick right with that.
	     
	     Q	  Are you concerned, sir, that you may have generated 
expectations on their end and criticism among others that has 
hamstrung your administration in the sense of far too great emphasis 
on this issue?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, but I have not placed a great deal 
of emphasis on it.  It's gotten a lot of emphasis in other quarters 
and in the press.  I've just simply taken my position and tried to 
see it through.  And that's what I do.  It doesn't take a lot of my 
time as President to say what I believe in and what I intend to do, 
and that's what I'll continue to do.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, getting back to the situation in 
Bosnia -- and we understand you haven't made any final decisions on 
new options previously considered unacceptable.  But the two most 
commonly heard options would be lifting the arms embargo to enable 
the Bosnian Muslims to defend themselves and to initiate some limited 
air strikes, perhaps, to cut off supply lines.  Without telling us 
your decision -- presumably, you haven't made any final decisions on 
those two options -- what are the pros and cons that are going 
through your mind right now and will weigh heavily on your final 
decision?  
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I'm reluctant to get into this.  There 
are -- those are two of the options.  There are some other options 
that have been considered.  All have pluses and minuses; all have 
supporters and opponents within the administration and in the 
Congress, where, I would remind you, heavy consultations will be 
required to embark on any new policy.
	     
	     I do believe that on the air strike issue, the 
pronouncements that General Powell has made generally about military 
action, apply there.  If you take action, if the United States takes 
action, we must have a clearly-defined objective that can be met.  We 
must be able to understand it and its limitations must be clear.  The 
United States is not, should not, become involved as a partisan in a 
war.  
	     
	     With regard to the lifting of the arms embargo, the 
question obviously there is if you widen the capacity of people to 
fight will that help to get a settlement and bring about peace?  Will 
it lead to more bloodshed?  What kind of reaction can others have 
that would undermine the effectiveness of the policy?
	     
	     But I think both of them deserve some serious 
consideration, along with some other options we have.
	     
	     Q	  Do you think that these people who are trying to 
get us into war in Bosnia are really remembering that we haven't 
taken care of hundreds of thousands of veterans from the last war and 
we couldn't take care of our prisoners and get them all home from 
Vietnam?   And now many of them are coming up with bills for 
treatment of Agent Orange.  How can we afford to go to any more of 
these wars?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that's a good argument 
against the United States itself becoming involved as a belligerent 
in a war there.  But we are, after all, the world's only super power.  
We do have to lead the world  and there is a very serious problem of 
systematic ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, which could 
have not only enormous further humanitarian consequences -- and 
goodness knows there have been many -- but also could have other 
practical consequences in other nearby regions where the same sorts 
of ethnic tensions exist.

	     Q	  Did you make any kind of agreement with Boris 
Yeltsin to hold off either on air strikes or any kind of aggressive 
action against the Serbs until after Sunday?  And in general, how has 
his political situation affected your deliberation on Bosnia?

	     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I have not made any agreement, and 
he did not ask for that.  We never even discussed that, interestingly 
enough.  The Russians, I would remind you, in the middle of President 
Yeltsin's campaign, abstained from our attempt to get tougher 
sanctions through the United Nations in what I thought was the proper 
decision for them and one that the United States and, I'm sure, the 
rest of the free world very much appreciated. 

	     Q	  Do you wish, Mr. President, that you'd become more 
involved in the planning of the Waco operation?  And how would you 
handle that situation differently now?

	     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't think as a practical matter that 
the President should become involved in the planning of those kinds 
of things at that detail.  One of the things that I'm sure will come 
out when we look into this is -- the questions will be asked and 
answered, did all of us who up the line of command ask the questions 
we should have asked and get the answers we should have gotten?  And 
I look forward to that.  But at the time, I have to say, as I did 
before, the first thing I did after the ATF agents were killed, once 
we knew that the FBI was going to go in, was to ask that the military 
be consulted because of the quasi, as least, military nature of the 
conflict given the resources that Koresh had in his compound and 
their obvious willingness to use them.  And then on the day before 
the action, I asked the questions of the Attorney General which I 
have reported to you previously, and which at the time I thought were 
sufficient.  I have -- as I said, I'm sure -- I leave it to others to 
make the suggestions about whether there are other questions I should 
have asked.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, what is your assessment of Director 
Sessions' role in the Waco affair?  And have you made a decision on 
his future?  And if you haven't, will you give him a personal hearing 
before you do decide?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I have no assessment 
of his role since I had no direct contact with him.  And I mean no 
negative or positive inference.  I have no assessment there.  I stand 
by what I said before about my general high regard for the FBI.  And 
I'm waiting for a recommendation from the Attorney General about what 
to do with the direction of the FBI.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, since you said that one side in 
Bosnia conflict represents inhumanity that the Holocaust carried to 
the nth degree, why do you then tell us that the United States cannot 
take a partisan view in this war?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I said that the principle of 
ethnic cleansing is something we ought to stand up against.  That 
does not mean that the United States or the United Nations can enter 
a war, in effect, to redraw the lines, geographical lines of 
republics within what was Yugoslavia, or that that would ultimately 
be successful.
	     
	     I think what the United States has to do is to try to 
figure out whether there is some way consistent with forcing the 
people to resolve their own difficulties we can stand up to and stop 
ethnic cleansing.  And that is obviously the difficulty we are 
wrestling with.  This is clearly the most difficult foreign policy 
problem we face, and that all of our allies face.  And if it were 
easy, I suppose it would have been solved before.  We have tried to 
do more in the last 90 days than was previously done.  It has clearly 
not been enough to stop the Serbian aggression, and  we are now 
looking at what else we can do.
	     
	     Q	  Yesterday you specifically criticized the Roosevelt 
administration for not having bombed the railroads to the 
concentration camps and things that were near military targets.  
Aren't there steps like that that would not involve conflict --direct 
conflict or partisan belligerence that you might consider?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  There may be.  I would remind you that 
the circumstances were somewhat different.  We were then at war with 
Germany at the time and that's what made that whole incident so --
series of incidents -- so perplexing.  But we have -- as I say, we've 
got all of our options under review.
	     
	     Q	  The diplomatic initiative on Haiti is on the verge 
of collapse.  What can you do to salvage it short of a full-scale 
military operation?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you may know something I don't.  
That's not what our people tell me.  I think Mr. Caputo and 
Ambassador Pezzullo have done together a good job.  The thing keeps 
going back and forth because of the people who are involved with the 
de facto government there.  It's obvious what their concerns are.  
They were the same concerns that led to the ouster of Aristide in the 
first place, and President Aristide, we feel, should be restored to 
power.  We're working toward that.  I get a report on that -- we 
discuss it at least three times a week, and I'm convinced that we're 
going to prevail there and be successful.  
	     
	     I do believe that there's every reason to think that 
there will have to be some sort of multilateral presence to try to 
guarantee the security and the freedom from violence of people on 
both sides of the ledger while we try to establish the conditions of 
ongoing civilized society.  But I believe we're going to prevail 
there.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, would you care to make your 
assessment of the first 100 days before we make one for you?  
(Laughter.)
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I'll say if -- I believe, first of 
all, we passed the budget resolution in record time.  That was the 
biggest issue.  That confirmed the direction of the administration 
and confirmed the commitments of the campaign that we could both 
bring the deficit down and increase investment, and that we could do 
it by specific spending cuts and by raising taxes, almost all of 
which come from the highest income people in this society --reversing 
a 12-year trend in which most of the tax burdens were borne by the 
middle class, whose incomes were going down when their taxes were 
going up, while the deficit went from $1 trillion to $4 trillion, the 
total national debt, and the deficit continued to go up.
	     
	     We have a 20-year low in interest rates from mortgages. 
We have lower interest rates across the board.  We have tens of 
billions of dollars flooding back into this economy as people 
refinance their debt.  
	     
	     We have established a new environmental policy, which is 
dramatically different.  The Secretary of Education has worked with 
me and with others and with the governors to establish a new approach 
in education that focuses on tough standards, as well as increasing 
opportunity.  We have done an enormous amount of work on political 
reform, on campaign finance and lobbying reform.  And I have imposed 
tough ethics requirements on my own administration's officials.  
These things are consistent with not only what I said I'd do in the 
campaign, but with turning the country around.  The Vice President is 
heading a task force which will literally change the way the federal 
government operates and make it much more responsive to the citizens 
of this country.  
	     
	     We are working on a whole range of other things.  The 
welfare reform initiative, to move people from welfare to work.  And, 
of course, a massive amount of work has been done on the health care 
issue, which is a huge economic and personal security problem for 
millions of Americans.  
	     
	     So I think it is amazing how much has been done.  More 
will be done.  We also passed the Family Leave bill.  A version of 
the motor voter bill -- that has not come out of conference back to 
me yet.  And everything has been passed except the stimulus program.  
So I think we're doing fine and we're moving in the right direction.  
I feel good about it.
	     
	     Q	  Sir, a follow-up.  Wouldn't you say, though, that 
one of your biggest initiatives, aid to Soviet Russia, is now 
practically finished -- if we can't pass a stimulus bill in our own 
country, how can we do it for them?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me recast the question a little bit.  
It's a good question -- (laughter) -- it's a good question, but to be 
fair we've got to recast it.  We have already -- the first round of 
aid to the Soviet -- to non-Soviet Russia, to a democratic Russia, is 
plainly going to go through, the first $1.6 billion.  The aid that we 
agreed with our partners in the G-7 to provide through the 
international financial institutions, which is a big dollar item, is 
plainly going to go through.  The question is, can we get any more 
aid for Russia that requires a new appropriation by the United States 
Congress?  And that is a question I think, Mary, that will be 
resolved in the weeks ahead, in part by what happens to the American 
workers and their jobs and their future.  I think the two things will 
be tied by many members of Congress.

	     Q	  The tailhook report came out this morning, 
documenting horrendous and nearly-criminal conduct on the part of the 
Navy.  How much did you discuss the incident and what might be done 
about it with your nominee to be the Secretary of the Navy?

	     THE PRESIDENT:  First, let me comment a little on that.  
The Inspector General's report details conduct which is wrong and 
which has no place in the armed services.  And I expect the report to 
be acted on in the appropriate way.  I also want to say to the 
American people and to all of you that the report should be taken for 
what it is, a very disturbing list of allegations which will have to 
be thoroughly examined.  It should not be taken as a general 
indictment of the United States Navy or of all the fine people who 
serve there.  It is very specific in its allegations, and it will be 
pursued.  

	     The only thing I said to the Secretary-Designate of the 
Navy and the only thing I should have said to him, I think, is that I 
expected him to take the report and to do his duty.  And I believe he 
will do that.

	     Q	  Mr. President, to back to Russia for just a minute.  
The latest poll show that Mr. Yeltsin will probably win his vote of 
confidence.  But there seems to be a real toss-up on whether or not 
voters are going to endorse his economic reforms.  

	     THE PRESIDENT:  I understand that.  

	     Q	  Can you live with a split -- (laughter) -- can you 
live with a split decision, though, or do you need both passed in 
order to then build support for Russian aid?

	     THE PRESIDENT:  I believe -- the answer to your question 
is, for the United States, the key question should be that which is 
posed to any democracy, which is who wins the election.  If he wins 
the election, if he is ratified by the Russian people to continue as 
their President, then I think we should do our best to work with him 
toward reform.
	     
	     You know, we had a lot of other countries here for the 
Holocaust Museum dedication -- their leaders were here.  Leaders from 
Eastern Europe, leaders from at least one republic of the former 
Soviet Union; all of them having terrible economic challenges as they 
convert from a communist command and control economy to a market 
economy in a world where there's economic slowdown everywhere.  And 
in a world in which there's economic slowdown and difficulty, all 
leaders will have trouble having their policies be popular in a poll 
because they haven't produced the results that the people so 
earnestly yearn for.  You can understand that.  
	     
	     But if they have confidence in the leadership, I think 
that's all we can ask.  And the United States will -- if the Russian 
people ratify him as their President and stick with him then the 
United States will continue to work with him.  I think he is a 
genuine democrat -- small d -- and genuinely committed to reform.  I 
think that we should support that.

	     Q	  Mr. President, Mr. Perot has come out strongly in 
what is perceived behind the line against a free trade agreement --
NAFTA.  How hard are you going to fight for this free trade agreement 
and when do you expect to see it accomplished?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I think we'll have the agreement ready 
in the fairly near future.  You know, our people are still working 
with the Mexican government and with the Canadians on the side 
agreements.  We're trying to work out what the environmental 
agreement will say, what the labor agreement will say, and then what 
the fairest way to deal with enforcement is.  
	     
	     The Mexicans say, and there is some merit to their 
position, that they're worried about transferring their sovereignty 
in enforcement to a multilateral commission.  Even in the United 
States, to be fair, we have some folks who are worried about that --
about giving that up.  On the other hand, if we're going to have an 
environmental agreement and a labor standards agreement that means 
something, then there has to be ultimately some consequences for 
violating them.  So what we're trying to do is to agree on an 
approach which would say that if there is a pattern of violations --
if you keep on violating it past a certain point -- maybe not an 
isolated incident, but a pattern of violation -- there is going to be 
some enforcement.  There must be consequences.  And we're working out 
the details of that.
	     
	     But I still feel quite good about it.  And this is just 
an area where I disagree with Mr. Perot and with others.  I think 
that we will win big if we have a fair agreement that integrates more 
closely the Mexican economy and the American economy and leads us 
from there to Chile to other market economies in Latin America, and 
gives us a bigger world in which to trade.  I think that's the only 
way a rich country can grow richer.  If you look at what Japan and 
other countries in the Pacific are doing to reach out in their own 
region, it's a pretty good lesson to us that we had better worry 
about how to build those bridges in our own area.  
	     
	     So this is an idea battle.  You know, you've got a lot 
of questions and I want to answer them all, but let me say not every 
one of these things can be distilled simply into politics -- you 
know, who's for this and who's for that, and if this person is for 
this, somebody else has got to be for that.  A lot of these things 
honestly involved real debates over ideas, over who's right and wrong 
about the world toward which we're moving.  And the answers are not 
self-evident.  And one of the reasons that I wanted to run for 
President is I wanted to sort of open the floodgates for debating 
these ideas so that we could try to change in the appropriate way.  
So I just have a difference of opinion.  I believe that the concept 
of NAFTA is sound, even though, as you know, I thought that the 
details needed to be improved.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, there was a tremendous flurry of 
interest earlier this month in the Russian document that purported to 
show that the Vietnamese had held back American prisoners.  General 
Vessey has now said publicly that while the document itself was 
authentic, he believes that it was incorrect.  Do you have a personal 
view at this point about that issue?  And more broadly, do you 
believe that, in fact, the Vietnamese did return all the American 
prisoners at the time of the Paris Peace Accord?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  First let me say, I saw General Vessey 
before he went to Vietnam and after he returned.  And I have a high 
regard for him and I appreciate his willingness to serve his country 
in this way.  As to whether the document had any basis in fact, let 
me say that the government of Vietnam was more forthcoming than it 
had been in the past and gave us some documents that would tend to 
undermine the validity of the Russian documents claim.
	     
	     I do not know whether that is right or wrong.  We are 
having it basically evaluated at this time, and when we complete the 
evaluation, we'll tell you.  And, of course, we want to tell the 
families of those who were missing in action or who were POWs.  I 
think that we'll be able to make some progress in eliminating some of 
the questions about the outstanding cases as a result of this last 
interchange, but I cannot say that I'm fully satisfied that we know 
all that we need to know.  There are still some cases that we don't 
know the answer to.  But I do believe we're making some progress.  I 
was encouraged by the last trip.
	     
	     Q	  I'd like to follow up on that.  Before the U.S. 
normalizes relations, allows trade to go forward, do you have to be 
personally sure that every case has been resolved or would you be 
willing to go forward on the basis that while it may take years to 
resolve these cases, the Vietnamese have made sufficient offerings to 
us to confirm good faith?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  A lot of experts say you can never 
resolve every case, every one, that we couldn't resolve all the cases 
for them and that there are still some cases that have not been 
factually resolved, going back to the Second World War.  But what I 
would have to be convinced of is that we had gone a long way toward 
resolving every case that could be resolved at this moment in time, 
and that there was a complete, open and unrestricted commitment to 
continue to do everything that could be done always to keep resolving 
those cases.  And we're not there yet.  
	     
	     Again, I have to be guided a little bit by people who 
know a lot about this.  And I confess to being much more heavily 
influenced by the families of the people whose lives were lost there, 
or whose lives remain in question than by the commercial interest and 
the other things which seem so compelling in this moment.  I just am 
very influenced by how the families feel.
	     
	     Q	     your economic stimulus package, are you doing 
some kind of reality check now and scaling back some of your plans, 
your legislative plans for the coming year, including the crime bill, 
the health care initiative and other things?  Are there any plans to 
do that?  And also, did you underestimate the power of Senator Bob 
Dole?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  No, what I underestimated was the extent 
to which what I thought was a fairly self-evident case, particularly 
after we stayed below the spending caps approved by this Congress, 
including the Republicans who were in this Congress last year -- when 
we had already passed a budget resolution which called for over $500 
billion in deficit reduction.  When they had voted repeatedly for 
supplemental appropriations to help foreign governments, I thought at 
least four of them would vote to break cloture, and I underestimated 
that.  I did not have an adequate strategy of dealing with that.  
	     
	     I also thought that if I made a good-faith effort to 
negotiate and to compromise, that it would not be rebuffed.  Instead, 
every time I offered something they reduced the offer that they had 
previously been talking to the Majority Leader about.  So it was a 
strange set of events.  But I think what happened was what was a 
significant part of our plan, but not the major part of it, acquired 
a political connotation that got out of proportion to the merits, so 
that a lot of Republicans were saying to me privately, ""Mr. 
President, I'd like to be for this, but I can't now.  And we're all 
strung out and we're divided.""  
	     
	     And I think we need to do a reality check.  As I said, 
what I want to know -- let me go back to what I said -- what I want 
to know from our folks and from our friends in the Senate on -- and 
Republicans or Democrats -- is what could I have done differently to 
make it come out differently.  Because the real losers here were not 
the President and the administration.  The real losers were the 
hundreds of thousands of people who won't have jobs now.  We could 
have put another 700,000 kids to work this summer.  I mean, we could 
have done a lot of good things with that money.  And I think that is 
very, very sad.  And it became more political than it should have.  
But the underlying rationale I don't think holds a lot of water --
that it was deficit spending.  That just won't wash.
	     
	     Q	     and redo --
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  No.  I mean, you know, for example --you 
mentioned the crime bill.  I think it would be a real mistake not to 
pass the crime bill.  I mean, the crime bill was almost on the point 
of passage last year.  And they were all fighting over the Brady 
Bill.  Surely, surely after what we have been through in this country 
just in the last three months, with the kind of mindless violence we 
have seen, we can pass a bill requiring people to go through a 
waiting period before they buy a handgun.  And surely we can see that 
we need more police officers on the street.  
	     
	     That's another thing that -- I really believe that once 
we move some of that money -- not all, but some of it up into this 
jobs package to make some of the jobs rehiring police officers on the 
street who'd been laid off, that would be a compelling case.  I mean 
people are scared in this country and I think we need to go forward. 
I feel very strongly that we need to go forward on the crime bill.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, back to the tailhook report for a 
second.  That report contained very strong criticism of the Navy's 
senior leadership in general, but did not name any of the senior 
officers.  Do you believe that the senior officers who are implicated 
in this, including Admiral Kelso who was there one night in Las 
Vegas, should they be disciplined and do you believe the public has a 
right to know the names of the senior officers?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  You should know that under the rules of 
law which apply to this, I am in the chain of command.  There is now 
an Inspector General's report and the law must take its course.  If I 
were to answer that question I might prejudice any decisions which 
might be later made in this case.  I don't really think -- I think 
all I can tell you is what I have already said.  I was very disturbed 
by the specific allegations in the Inspector General's report, and I 
want appropriate action to be taken.  
	     
	     Until the proper procedures have a chance to kick in and 
appropriate action is taken, I have been advised that because I am 
the Commander-in-Chief I have to be very careful about what I say so 
as not to prejudice the rights of anybody against whom any action 
might proceed or to prejudice the case in any other way either pro or 
con.  So I can't say any more except to say that I want this thing 
handled in an appropriate and thorough way.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, could I ask you for a clarification 
on Bosnia?  You said that you were not considering introduction of 
American forces.  Does that include any air forces as well as ground 
forces, sir?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I said ground forces.
	     
	     Q	  You said ground forces.  Could I ask you, sir, if 
you fear that using U.S. air strikes might  draw the United States 
into a ground war there?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I just don't want to discuss our 
evaluation of the options anymore.  I've told you that there's never 
been a serious discussion in this country about the introduction of 
ground forces into an ongoing conflict there.
	     
	     Q	  With hundreds of thousands of gays in Washington 
this weekend for the march, did you ever reconsider your decision to 
leave town for this weekend?  Did you ever consider in any way 
participating in some of the activities? 
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  No.
	     
	     Q	  Why not?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Because I -- and, basically, I wouldn't 
participate in other marches.  I think once you become President, on 
balance, except under unusual circumstances, that is not what should 
be done.  But more importantly, I'm going to the American Society of 
Newspaper Editors, a trip that presumably most of you would want me 
to make, to try to focus anew on what I think are the fundamental 
issues at stake for our country right now.  And I expect that I will 
say something about the fact that a lot of Americans have come here, 
asking for a climate that is free of discrimination; asking, 
basically, to be able to work hard and live by the rules and be 
treated like other American citizens if they do that, and just that.  
And that's always been my position -- not only for the gays who will 
be here, but for others as well.  
	     
	     Thank you very much.

                                 END1:48 P.M. EDT

  What is your proof that they ""did the best they could""?   Unless
  they had strong evidence that the children were in IMMEDIATE danger
  then ""the best they could"" have done was to SHOW RESTRAINT.

  Some of us DID predict this outcome, or at least suggested a
  strong possibility of it.  I, for one, said that in the event of
  an assault against the building the CHILDREN were the ones in danger
  either from the assault itself or from a ""Jonestown"" (my phrase
  a week after the seige started) style suicide.  And as I pointed
  out then, and repeatedly over the objections of people on the net 
  who disagreed with me, an adult may freely choose suicide but they
  have no right to impose this choice on their children.

  Now, while I don't expect the FBI to pay any attention to what I 
  have to say on this, I *DO* expect them to figure it out on their
  own or to take the advice of experts.  The cult specialist inter-
  viewed in yesterday's Boston Globe said he was repeatedly ""stonewalled""
  by the FBI when he pointed out to them that their confrontational
  tactics played perfectly into Koresh's mad view of the world and so 
  increased the chance of a tragic outcome.

>Some responses have gone so far to suggest that the actions were

  Give *US* a break!   Pumping teargas for 45 minutes into a compound 
  filled with CHILDREN?!!   This doesn't seem to show much regard for 
  their lives or safety.   ""Nontoxic teargas"" is an oxymoron.  Children
  have tiny respiratory passages which are easily blocked by the secretions
  induced by teargas; moreover teargas can easily cause fatalities in anyone
  subject to laryngospasms, asthma, or heart disease.

  If a madman is holding a gun to a hostage, someone who provokes the 
  madman by attacking him bears nearly as much repsonsibility for the
  death of the hostage as the madman himself.  These kinds of situations
  have to be handled *delicately* - not by surrounding a place with
  tanks and heavily armed personnel and blaring rock music from loud-
  speakers at all hours.   That approach is idiotic.  


>Be part of the solution - not the problem.

  The solution is to greatly reduce the authority of the ""the authorities"".
  The Feds showed themselves here, as they have so many times in the
  past, to be a gang of trigger-happy, impulsive, yahoos who cause more
  trouble than they prevent.    Their confrontational approach reinforced
  every single message Koresh was giving his followers, virtually guarantee-
  ing that whatever crazy solution Koresh proposed would be followed
  willingly.   This was pointed out here, on Compuserve, in the press,
  just about every place except in the Justice Department where it seems
  a n.i.h. philosophy prevails.

  Do we want to 'create jobs'? or do we want jobs created that are productive
  in our supply/demand economy? If your answer is the former then we can
  just round up all jobless people and pay them to build sandcastles in
  the desert. If you answer the latter then I fail to see how another

                          The Briefing Room


12:36 P.M. EDT
	     
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, the President is going 
to come out at 1:15 p.m.  With your indulgence, I think what we'd 
like to do is have the President award the National Teacher's Award 
first and then have the teacher leave, or whatever, and then he'll 
make a statement on Waco and take a couple questions.  So if we can 
just hold off going live and all that until that's done, it probably 
will work out a lot better. 
	     
	     Q	  If you'll give us the time.  That's the problem.
	     
	     Q	  We've got a two-minute warning problem.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, it is a problem.  It's about 
1:15 p.m.
	     
	     Q	  The teacher would walk off and then --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's -- I'm just trying 
to work this out here.  I think that's the best way to handle it.
	     
	     Q	  Can I ask you a series of questions about the way 
the President handled the notifications yesterday? 
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.
	     
	     Q	  Did you, for instance, talk to the Justice 
Department about who would come out and discuss what had happened in 
Waco and whether it should be the Attorney General or the President?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Why don't we just take a step even 
farther back from that and look at the whole sequence of events on 
the contact between the Justice Department and the White House.  As 
you know and as we've said, the President spoke with the Attorney 
General on Sunday, Sunday afternoon.  They had a good discussion, 
about 15 minutes.  The Attorney General informed the President of 
what she wanted to do.  He raised no objections.  Obviously, she had 
the implicit authority from the President to go forward.  He raised 
no objections.  She went forward.  They had a discussion of a general 
nature about the incident.
	     
	     Again, yesterday morning around 11:00 a.m., the 
President spoke with the Attorney General again.  They had a brief 
discussion over what was happening in Waco.  As you know, this was 
before the fire broke out at the compound.  And I think that was why 
there was some -- just some confusion.  I think that she was 
confusing in her minds before and after the fire, not the actual day 
when they spoke.  
	     
	     Then there was a number of contacts at a number of 
different levels in the White House yesterday afternoon between the 
Justice Department and the White House.  They were informing us of 

their decisions, what they would like to do.  There was an FBI 
briefing in Waco.  The Attorney General had her press conference.  
The President then issued a statement after that.
	     
	     Frankly, yesterday afternoon, you know, there was a fair 
amount of confusion over exactly what was happening on the ground in 
Waco, and I think that we wanted to be very careful not to have the 
President say anything until we had a much better sense of what was 
actually happening on the ground.  Once we were fairly clear on what 
was happening on the ground in Waco, the President issued a 
statement.  He spoke with the Attorney General again yesterday 
evening.
	     
	     Q	  At what hour was that?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It was quite late.  I believe it 
was after he returned from the Holocaust Museum.  He took a tour of 
the Holocaust Museum last night.
	     
	     Q	  And he went out to dinner.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe briefly.  Yes, he went to 
dinner and then he spoke with the Attorney General last night.  I 
don't know the exact time; I think it was relatively late.  And he 
just said, I think as Dee Dee has reported, that he just wanted to 
tell her that he thought she handled a difficult situation very well, 
that she did a good job in a tough situation, and that she should try 
and get some sleep.  He then, again, spoke with her this morning 
about the follow-up in Waco, and about what they're going to do this 
afternoon.  As you know, the President will have an announcement to 
make at 1:15.
	     
	     Q	  Did he ever talk with Webb Hubbell yesterday, last 
night, or this morning?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, no.
	     
	     Q	  Was Webb Hubbell the point man for the White House?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Webb Hubbell is the general White 
House Liaison and several people talked to Webb.  The Attorney 
General was running the operation.
	     
	     Q	  Did he tell her that she should sleep well, that 
she had done a good job?  Or he just tell her that she should get 
some sleep?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think sleep well -- done a good 
job -- I don't know the exact words.  I think that sounds right.
	     
	     Q	  I mean, sleep well has implications as to 
conscience and whether she should feel badly about it or not.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean, I think everybody 
feels badly when you have a situation when --
	     
	     Q	  I understand that, but whether the issue of blame 
is brought up in that phraseology.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's the spirit -- no, it 
has nothing to do with that.  The spirit with which it was offered 
was that the entire administration and certainly the Attorney General 
had to face a very difficult decision, a very difficult situation 
yesterday.  And that he thought that she had handled it well, as best 
as she could and --
	     
	     Q	  Well, does he think it was mishandled?

	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- it was just speaking of warm 
words to a friend.
	     
	     Q	  Does he think the situation was mishandled?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President --
	     
	     Q	  In retrospect?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President stands  by the 
decisions of the law enforcement agencies, the decisions of the 
Attorney General.  He accepts full responsibility.  At the same time, 
I think that we all want to look to the future and figure out what 
exactly happened, do a full review, and make sure we do what we can 
to make sure this doesn't happen -- this kind of thing doesn't happen 
again, or at least we know how to handle it.
	     
	     Q	  How much did he know about what she was going to go 
ahead with?  I know that she made the case to him -- explained --
outlined the case for action.  Did she say to him on Sunday precisely 
what action?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think it was specific 
operational detail as to what was going to happen.  I think that they 
had a general discussion about the action, about the advisability of 
action.  I think, as she noted, he asked a few general questions just 
trying to get a sense of how things were considered.  But it wasn't 
minute-by-minute detail of how the operation --
	     
	     Q	  Well, was it, ""we are going in.""  Is it, ""we're 
going to use tear gas""?  I mean, what?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe it was that we want to go 
in and take some action that would increase the pressure on those in 
the compound, and hopefully spur them towards some sort of movement 
out.
	     
	     Q	  George, was there ever a conscious political 
decision made, or even a discussion about distancing the President 
from --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  I mean, we were in 
close contact with the Justice Department.  The President accepts 
responsibility for this.  At the same time -- I mean, we just wanted 
to be very, very clear about how this happened and be as factual as 
we could be on how the decisions were made.  It is the responsibility 
of those on the ground to make recommendations.  The Attorney General 
has operational control over this.  The President obviously accepts 
responsibility for all of this, and he stands by the Attorney 
General.
	     
	     Q	  George, there was a report on the television today 
-- and I don't know more than that -- one of the members of the cult 
had said going into a courthouse that the FBI had started the fire 
and not themselves.  There was also a picture yesterday on the TV of 
a smashing into the building  where the fire broke out.  And my 
question is, is the White House absolutely certain that this fire was 
--
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  All the evidence we have is that 
this fire was started by David Koresh and those inside the compound 
-- every bit of evidence we have.
	     
	     Q	  Did the President ask the Attorney General why do 
this now, why this particular date, and did he ask about possible 
consequences of either death or injury?

	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know the specific 
questions.  He had general questions about how the decision was going 
about being made.
	     
	     Q	  Those are general questions and did he ask 
generally, why now?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he asked, have you 
considered all of the consequences; have you considered the 
recommendations?  I don't know if he asked the question, ""why now?  ""  
I don't know if he asked that specific question.
	     
	     Q	  Did she tell him why now in terms of the stuff 
that's come out since then about the information provided by the 
listening device about Koresh getting increasingly more violent?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I'm not certain how much 
specific detail they got into.  I know that she generally said that 
this is the recommendation she's prepared to make, I mean, the 
decision she's prepared to make.  It's based on the recommendations 
she was receiving from the field and after intensive questioning of 
those involved.  Again, I do not know how precisely detailed it was 
beyond that.
	     
	     Q	  What is the President's understanding why 
yesterday?  One of the people who went into the compound a couple 
weeks ago came out over the weekend with some speculation that he may 
have told law enforcement people something that precipitated this 
action.  Why yesterday?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  This is the first I've heard.  I 
think what we can go to is what the FBI and the Attorney General has 
said.  There were indications that those inside the compound were at 
some danger.  It was clear that the negotiations had broken down and 
it was the judgment of the experts involved in the negotiations that 
the situation was not going to get any better at all.  
	     
	     There was also some concern over the vulnerability of 
the agents themselves who had been working long beyond the time that 
these teams normally have to work.  And as the Attorney General has 
said, there was some concern over the fact that they did not have 
replacements in place who could stand in for them, and there was a 
concern over the safety.  
	     
	     All of these factors came into play.  They also 
considered the advice of a number of psychologists and other experts 
on David Koresh and those in the compound.  I would just go back to 
what the Attorney General has said.  You have to make the best 
judgment you can, given the information you have at the time.  They 
did.  Obviously, we all regret the loss of life.  It's a terribly 
unfortunate situation.  We all wish it could have turned out 
differently, but that doesn't take away from the judgments that were 
made at the time.
	     
	     Q	  George, when did the President know that they were 
going to use tear gas?  Was it before the assault on the compound?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don't know.  I don't believe 
he was given a lot of detail on exactly how the operation would go.  
I just don't know.
	     
	     Q	  Along that point, George, can you say whether the 
plan was presented to the President by the Attorney General as a way 
to end the standoff one way or the other yesterday?
	     

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was presented as a way 
to increase the pressure on those in the compound and, we all hoped, 
as a way to move some of those out and bring it in -- it wasn't 
presented as tomorrow is D-Day, this is it.
	     
	     Q	  Is the President satisfied that, A, he had all this 
relevant information necessary to make a decision, and B, that Janet 
Reno had all the relevant information necessary to make a decision?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, I think he's satisfied that 
they were acting on the best advice and the best information they 
had, and he's not second-guessing it in any way whatsoever.
	     
	     Q	  George, was there a 12-hour gap between 
conversations between the President and the Attorney General?  In 
other words, they spoke at 11:00 a.m. and they didn't speak again 
until Clinton got back from dinner at --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's likely, yes.
	     
	     Q	  Did he call her?  What time did she call?  Was 
there a gap between when she called him?  I mean, was he at dinner 
when she called and --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no, no.  I think he called her 
last night.  I couldn't swear to it, but I believe he called her last 
night.  He just wanted to talk to her.
	     
	     Q	     what was going on?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not that I know of, no.
	     
	     Q	  What do you know about the situation now?  Everyone 
has perished who -- except eight or nine?  And do you know any of the 
other details?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know any more details than 
the FBI reported in Waco.
	     
	     Q	     watching CNN or how was he keeping track of what 
is going on?  If he wasn't talking to his Attorney General, how was 
he keeping track of what was going on here?  I mean, with all due 
respect to CNN, is that how he was doing it?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  There was also -- as I said, 
several people in the White House were in constant contact with their 
counterparts at Justice to have the full and complete information.
	     
	     Q	  Who were those contacts?  I mean, was it Mack 
McLarty, Webb Hubbell?  How was the President being kept informed?  
That's not a --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe Mack was in contact with 
Webb.  I spoke with several people at the Justice Department.  I 
believe Bruce Lindsey spoke with people at the Justice Department.  
Either Bernie or Vince was also in contact at different times during 
the day with people at the Justice Department.  We were fully briefed 
and fully informed.
	     
	     Q	  We were told this morning that the President may 
have spoken -- a chance that he may have spoken with Webb.  Do you 
know if that's true or not?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there's a chance he may 
have.  I don't believe he did, but I think there's certainly a chance 
that he may have at some point.  I don't believe he did.  I think 
that the last contact he had during the day yesterday directly with 

the Justice Department was the 11:00 a.m. phone call with the 
Attorney General.  But the White House was fully informed on a 
minute-to-minute basis of what was happening in Waco and what was 
happening at the Justice Department.
	     
	     Q	  George, who decided that the briefing would be done 
by the Attorney General?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Attorney General.
	     
	     Q	  Did you or did the White House communications staff 
-- were you ever involved with that decision?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  We were told about it.
	     
	     Q	  Did you ask her to go on Nightline and MacNeil-
Lehrer and all that stuff?  Was that part of --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.
	     
	     Q	     there was no advice from the White House at all 
about her -- she was on all night, all day.  (Laughter.)
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, and she did a very good job. 
	     
	     Q	  Why did you decide to have the President's reaction 
to the situation be only a written statement, which is traditionally 
the White House's way of distancing the President from the issue, not 
having him appear as personally saying anything?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, that wasn't the intent at 
all.  As I said, we had to -- we wanted to wait until we had all of 
the information at hand.  The President is also making a statement 
today.  The President made a statement yesterday morning.  The 
President has been fully involved --
	     
	     Q	  After this turned into less than a successful 
operation, the only statement from the President was what was on 
paper after the Attorney General had already given what amounted to 
the major facts in this.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it was the first statement 
from the President, not the only statement from the President, number 
one.  
	     
	     Q	  After the --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Number two -- well, the first.  
Number two, the Attorney General --
	     
	     Q	  He gave a statement early in the morning when the 
thing was starting to move --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  And he gave one yesterday 
and he's giving one today.  Now, the second point --
	     
	     Q	  It just happens this was a written statement with 
no sort of communications policy or thought process involved?  It was 
the President wants to put out a written statement?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Knowing what we knew at the time, 
we thought it was appropriate for the President and he thought it was 
appropriate to put out a written statement expressing his regret and 
expressing his support for the Attorney General's --
	     
	     Q	  Why was it not appropriate for him to personally do 
something?

	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, he did personally do so.  
That is his statement.  It's a statement under his name.
	     
	     Q	  George, yesterday during the briefing you didn't 
say the President took full responsibility for what happened --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I certainly did.
	     
	     Q	  No, what you said was --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's just not right, Susan.
	     
	     Q	  Well, I think you can go back to the transcript, I 
mean, unless I miss something --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'd love to.
	     
	     Q	     Janet Reno said that she took full 
responsibility and you said that she made the decision, that the FBI 
--
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And the President takes 
responsibility.  Absolutely.
	     
	     Q	  Took responsibility -- all right.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Check the transcript.
	     
	     Q	  Considering how little was known about what was 
going on inside the compound and, even now, how little is known, why 
is Washington calling this a mass suicide?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I think that knowing what we 
know now and given all of the actions of David Koresh before and 
during, it is painfully clear that those there were under his 
control.
	     
	     Q	  It's stretching it a little bit where the kids are 
concerned, though, isn't it, George?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that that is an entirely 
different matter.  I mean, I think that David Koresh must bear 
responsibility for the deaths of those children, absolutely.  But he 
clearly was intent on creating some kind of an apocalyptic incident, 
and that's what he did.
	     
	     Q	  You're still operating completely on assumption, 
right?  I mean, you have no evidence, or you know of no evidence that 
this was mass suicide.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We have evidence that those inside 
the compound set fire to the compound, which led to the deaths of 
those inside.
	     
	     Q	  I didn't quite hear it.  This might be Ann's 
question, I didn't quite hear it.  But at what time did Clinton 
himself put out a statement on this?  I know Dee Dee said some stuff 
on this at 6:00 p.m., but the President put out --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  At 6:35 p.m., 6:40 p.m.
	     
	     Q	  Right after the evening news went on the air?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, right when we had all the 
information.  We were working on it.
	     

	     Q 	  Dee Dee confirmed this morning that the 
investigation the President is going to announce is going to be an 
administration-run investigation.  Why not have someone from the 
outside to make sure that it's not colored by those who would have a 
political stake, particularly those at the ATF whose actions have 
already been --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that clearly the ATF and 
the Justice Department will bear responsibility for the 
investigation.  That's not to rule out, as is often in investigations 
like this, having some sort of independent involvement as well.  But 
it will be run by the Treasury and Justice. 
	     
	     Q	  Are you confident that you will not have any 
problem getting --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.
	     
	     Q	  George, did the President reach out to anybody else 
to get advice after the meeting with Janet Reno?  And who else in the 
White House sat in on that meeting?  Anyone else from Justice?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't believe anybody else was 
there at the time.  It was a phone call on Monday, it wasn't a 
meeting.
	     
	     Q	  Sunday.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sunday.  It was a phone call, it 
wasn't a meeting.  I believe he might have been there with Bruce, but 
beyond that, I think he just talked to the Attorney General.
	     
	     Q	  George, you said that in that phone call, she said 
that we want to go in and take action, as you said, that will force 
him out.  What did he think she was talking about?  If he didn't know 
about tear gas, what exactly was his idea of what he was approving?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he was approving an action 
to increase the pressure on --
	     
	     qQ	   It didn't matter how she did that?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no.  I mean --
	     
	     Q	  What information did he have in terms of how this 
would proceed?  Presumably he would have wanted to know, not minute-
by-minute, but in a general sense --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he knew that this was the 
recommendation of those on the ground and the recommendation of the 
law enforcement agencies.  I just don't know --
	     
	     Q	  What is ""this"" -- when you say that ""this"" was the 
recommendation --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The action to increase pressure.  I 
don't know exactly what he was told -- whether he was going to be 
told that the tank was going to go up to the left wall and punch a 
hole in the window, or whether he was just told generally that they 
were moving forward in a way that would increase the pressure.  I 
just don't know.
	     
	     Q	  It's hard to imagine him not asking, though.
	     
	     Q	     that Janet Reno presented him with as her best 
advice about what they should go forward with, he would have agreed?
	     

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He was -- he did ask some general 
questions about the advice and recommendation he gave.  At the same 
time -- and I would repeat -- that this was based on the unanimous 
recommendation of the law enforcement agencies involved.
	     
	     Q	  George, it would seem that this question about just 
exactly in what detail the President was informed about the nature of 
the operation is going to come up again here and elsewhere.  Can you 
take that question and --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  Yes.
	     
	     Q	     get the answer and come back to us with all of 
it?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.
	     
	     Q	  Can you tell us that there was never a meeting -- a 
strategy session -- where you and others decided, we will put out a 
written statement from the President and we will have Janet Reno be 
on all of these television broadcasts?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Never.  Never.
	     
	     Q	  And you never called the Justice Department and 
said to anyone or Janet Reno, ""you're the one who needs to be out 
front explaining this""?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not once.
	     
	     Q	  It just happened that way that she was the 
spokesman, that no one ever saw Bill Sessions until --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  She made a decision as Attorney 
General that it was important for her as the operational officer in 
charge, as the person who made the decision, to go out and take the 
questions on this tragic incident.
	     
	     Q	  She had no guidance from the White House at all?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We certainly didn't object.
	     
	     Q	  But did you -- (laughter) -- no, I'm sure you 
didn't object, but did you suggest it?  Was this a plan --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No. Absolutely not.
	     
	     Q	     a strategy?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.
	     
	     Q	  Did she clear it?  
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.
	     
	     Q	  Did she notify you?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We certainly knew about it.
	     
	     Q	  What happened to this great detailed process you 
have for clearing and talking to every public information officer and 
every -- under every rock and every place in government that 
something as major as this could have occurred without a discussion 
between you and the public information people at least at the Justice 
Department?
	     

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Attorney General made the 
decision and the Attorney General wanted to go forward.  It seemed 
like a good decision.  It was a good decision.  She did a good job.
	     
	     Q	  Let me ask it this way, George, if in hindsight how 
you would handle it?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was handled very well.
	     
	     Q	  You wouldn't change a thing if --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Change what?
	     
	     Q	  The way the White House handled any part of it -- 
from start to finish.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I think that's an awful broad 
question and we're certainly going to have a review.  One of the 
reasons for the investigation is to look for ways in the future that 
something like this -- see what we can learn from an incident like 
this and see what we can learn about how to handle them.  If you're 
talking specifically about the issue of the press conferences, no, 
there -- wouldn't make any change at all.
	     
	     Q	  Two questions:  First of all, on her going on TV, 
no White House people or outside media consultants came up with this 
idea?  It's just very reminiscent of what you guys did during the 
campaign.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  How so?
	     
	     Q	  I'm thinking of like watching Clinton on Nightline 
after the draft story; watching Clinton on --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There's absolutely no comparison.  
Yesterday there was a law enforcement incident.  The incident ended 
in tragic deaths of many, many people.  The Attorney General was 
involved in that decision.  The Attorney General made the decision to 
do that.  She felt it was her responsibility in the interest of 
public information to go out and take the questions of the press in 
order to make sure that all of the questions were answered, and she 
did a fantastic job.
	     
	     Q	  The second question is, did -- as someone who knows 
Clinton as well as you do, can you understand why it's sort of hard 
to believe that he might not have asked some detailed questions about 
what she intended to do?  In other words, she came and she said, I'm 
going to put pressure on them.  It's hard not to see Clinton, who's 
fairly intelligent and inquisitive, asking how.
	     
	     Q	  What kind?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Both the Attorney General said that 
he did ask questions, he did ask general questions.  I don't have a 
minute-by-minute account of the conversation.
	     
	     Q	  How long a conversation?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was about 15 minutes.
	     
	     Q	  Telephone conversation?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.
	     
	     Q	  George, was the federal cost of this standoff ever 
a consideration in terms of stepping up the pressure --
	     

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't believe so, no.
	     
	     Q	  George, you keep saying that the President takes 
full responsibility, but then you refer to it as her decision.  Does 
the President not accept the fact that as Commander-In-Chief, it is 
ultimately his decision?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know what this has to do 
with Commander-In-Chief.  This was a law enforcement action, not a 
military action.  And he clearly takes responsibility for the 
decisions of the law enforcement agencies involved taken in his 
government.  I mean, I think there's just no ambiguity about that.
	     
	     Q	  But is he accepting it as his decision as well as 
hers, or is he saying it's her decision?  There's a difference.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As a matter of fact, it was her 
decision.  He did not object to that decision.  He clearly takes full 
responsibility. 
	     
	     Q	  George, this briefing has gone on just a little 
over 15 minutes, and as you can see a lot of things can be exchanged.  
What exactly did they spend 15 minutes talking about if it was just 
very general?  That's a long period of time in a phone conversation.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It is an awful long phone 
conversation.  It was a very important phone conversation.  I think 
Brit has asked that we take the question, and I've said that I would.
	     
	     Q	  One of the things Reno said last night is that the 
buck stops here.  I think that was her direct quotation.  Does the 
President agree with that in this case?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President says he accepts full 
responsibility.  I think what the Attorney General was saying is that 
she made a decision, that she's going to accept all the 
responsibility that comes to her.  And she's not shrinking from that 
at all, but neither is the President. 
	     
	     Q	  At any point in the conversation last night between 
the President and the Attorney General or this morning, did she ever 
offer her a resignation?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge. 
	     
	     Q	  Even before the fire was out yesterday, there were 
some Republicans on Capitol Hill calling for an investigation.  Is 
the White House at all concerned about the timing of those requests 
trying to make political hay out of this situation?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  And I don't want to cast any 
questions about the motives of those who are requesting 
investigation.  We want an investigation, and we'll have a full and 
complete investigation.
	     
	     Q	  In what forum will you answer Brit's question?  
Will you put out a written statement?  Will you -- the wires?  How 
will you answer the question that you've taken?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.
	     
	     Q	  George, can you remind us what the President was 
doing all yesterday afternoon, where he was, and what meetings he was 
involved in?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'll have to try and remember.  He 
had a series of meetings with different members of the staff during 

the afternoon.  He was certainly monitoring the situation in Waco and 
getting periodic reports on that as well.  He did see some on CNN as 
well.  I believe he saw a fair amount of the FBI press briefing as 
well.
	     
	     Q	  And those reports would have come to him from Mack 
McLarty, would they -- do you think?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Mack talked to him, Bruce talked to 
him, I talked to him.
	     
	     Q	  George, to follow Helen's question, in their 
conversation this morning did they discuss at all her statement last 
night in response to the question about whether she would resign?  
Did he say, I don't know why you felt the need to say that?  I'm here 
to reassure you that you don't have to do this?  Did that come up at 
all?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if it even came up 
that specifically.  I know that the bulk of the conversation was 
discussing where do we go from here and what form the investigation 
--
	     
	     Q	   The didn't talk at all about her kind of 
remarkable comment last night about --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I believe she was asked a 
question.
	     
	     Q	  And her response was, if the President wants me to, 
I will.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Which would be, I think, the 
standard response that most Cabinet members would give.  I mean, it's 
a conditional statement.
	     
	     Q	     have a need to talk about whether -- personally 
about whether the President wanted her --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they talked about 
it.  I mean, what I learned about the conversation was that it was 
largely about the investigation itself.  And this just didn't come 
up.  I did not ask the question if they talked about --
	     
	     Q	  Will you take that with the Brit package?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Certainly.  (Laughter.)
	     
	     Q	  George, for the record, does the President want her 
to resign?  I know Dee Dee answered this morning --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely not.  He supports Janet 
Reno.  She's a good Attorney General.  She's done a good job.  She 
handled a difficult situation extremely well.
	     
	     Q	  George, does the President feel that he and Janet 
Reno were let down by the unanimous professional advice from the law 
enforcement experts on the ground?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  And the President is not 
second-guessing that decision and those recommendations in any way.  
That is not to say that he doesn't regret the loss of life.  
Everybody regrets the loss of life in this situation.  But the best 
judgments were made in a difficult situation based on the best 
information we had.
	     

	     Q	  George, the 15-minute conversation was the one on 
Sunday, is that correct?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.
	     
	     Q	  How long was the one at 11:00 a.m. yesterday 
morning?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  I'll take that 
question, too.
	     
	     Q	  Were these outside experts that they were 
consulting with, or experts within the ATF and the FBI?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You'd have to ask them.  I'm just 
not sure.  I know that there were several experts.
	     
	     Q	  And also, why weren't there replacements for these 
people?  Is the unit that small?  
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I think it is a very small 
highly-specialized unit.  But I think it's one of the kinds of things 
that the investigation will examine.
	     
	     Q	  George, isn't there a factor here involving the FBI 
Director?  Normally, a president, when he wants to get information, 
doesn't only asks the Attorney General.  I know the chain of command.  
But presidents talk to their FBI directors.  In this case, throughout 
this entire siege, he has not felt that he could pick up the phone 
and talk to Bill Sessions, who is from Waco, and get expertise from 
him on what to do and what not to do?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he talked to the FBI 
Director well in the beginning of the situation when it first broke 
out in Waco.  At the same time, the Attorney General bears the 
ultimate responsibility and he was getting fully briefed from the 
Attorney General.
	     
	     Q	  Don't you think the ambiguous situation that 
Director Sessions is in has some impact on the way the President is 
briefed and on the way that all of this evolved?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  I mean, it's perfectly 
appropriate that he be briefed by the Attorney General and that the 
Attorney General has supervisory authority over the FBI Director, and 
that's following the chain of command.
	     
	     THE PRESS:  Thank you .

Koresh & some of his followers were tried and found *innocent* of
all charges following that shootout.  Were you unaware of this or

It is interesting, sometimes, to listen to U.S. news as seen through
the eyes of another country.......

B.B.C. world news service, on short-wave, originating out of London,
reports that a survivor of the Waco massacre states that a tank, when
making a hole in the wall of the building, knocked over a kerosene
lamp and that is how the fire started.  Attempts were made by the
people inside to put out the fire, but it spread too quickly.

Has anyone in U.S. heard anything similar or are U.S. government
spin-doctors censoring such information?

The B.B.C. news is also reporting that about 20 of those that died
were british citizens.

These ""criminals"" were threatening the lives of NO ONE -- they were fired

Wrong.  Firing a gun at someone is lethal force, even if no one is hit.
Of course, they DID hit AND kill people.

I think that Phil needs to get out a ruler and see exactly how big 50mm rounds
are - roughly 2"" diameter.  The type of stuff used in Anti-Aircraft gunnery.
.50 calibre is much smaller, but the 3000m effective range (~2mi) sounds about
right. Maybe he just got the two confused..... The FBI's reasoning was sound,
but the note from PH-B was factually wrong.

Yesterday, the FBI was saying that at least three of the bodies had
gunshot wounds, indicating that they were shot trying to escape the
fire.  Today's paper quotes the medical examiner as saying that there
is no evidence of gunshot wounds in any of the recovered bodies.

At the beginning of this siege, it was reported that while Koresh
had a class III (machine gun) license, today's paper quotes the
government as saying, no, they didn't have a license.

Today's paper reports that a number of the bodies were found with
shoulder weapons next to them, as if they had been using them while
dying -- which doesn't sound like the sort of action I would expect
from a suicide.

Our government lies, as it tries to cover over its incompetence
and negligence.  Why should I believe the FBI's claims about
anything else, when we can see that they are LYING?

This system of government is beyond reform.

Do it in private, and it won't be a problem.  But the reason that
the homosexual activists are so hot on antidiscrimination laws is
that they want:

1. To be able to wear that lovely chiffon evening gown to work, and
not have people get disgusted;

2. To be able to wear their NAMBLA T-shirt and not worry about
getting fired;

3. To be able to have access to young boys, so that they start
making the next generation of homosexuals.

If your right to privacy is what makes sodomy laws unconstitutional
(a position that I agree with), then keep it private, and there
won't be a problem.

No, we are getting at Mr. Foard's sickness.  This may surprise
homosexuals, but lots of people in this country do NOT spend their
time watching pornography and masturbating.  Some of us have 
real lives, instead of sexual compulsions.  But I don't expect
a homosexual to understand that.

I hate to disappoint you, but that's not the case.  I don't ""get off""
on lesbian sex, nor am I an adolescent.  Now, when I was an adolescent,
I believed that homosexuals were just like everyone else.  But I've
learned since then.

Correlation != causality.

The risk factor is having non-monogomous unprotected sex, not being

That has not been demonstrated.  Had he come to trial, there was a very real
possibility that Koresh would have gotten an acquittal on grounds of self-
defense.  All survivors of the debacle have sworn that the BATF shot first.

They ""rang the doorbell"" using a concussion grenade!  And if the bloody
warrants were ""legal"" then why were they _sealed_ after the fight started?
And if Koresh had declared himself a ""private state"" and was just daring the
gov't to go in, then why did he surrender last year to a local sheriff who
served a warrant _for_his_arrest_ (as opposed to the BATF search warrant,
which did not include arrest unless violations were found) by just calling
him up to tell him and then going out to collect him with his squad car?
That doesn't sound like a dictator to me, it sounds like someone who knows
he has a court battle.  Things might have gone very differently if the BATF
_had_ ""rung the doorbell"".

This is stupid.  That is no paranoid assertion, it is testamony from surviving
witnesses, and the BATF _has_ no tanks, nor am I aware of either the BATF _or_
the FBI using any until yesterday.  When they use maximum force they do just
what they did that first day that got four officers killed.

""Underarmed""?  You flabberghast me, they were loaded for bear and every
picture shows them wearing bullet-proof vests!  They were using concussion
grenades and full-auto weapons, what was missing low-yield tac-nukes?  This
is a transparent attempt to retcon a justification for the ridiculous amount
of force used, both initially and yesterday.  You should be ashamed.

>If anyone on the net cares to suggest a sure fire method of bringing

They _had_ a sure-fire method: keep them bottled up and talk them to death or
surrender without giving him justification for some looney-tune religious

FURY OF MOTHER NATURE

Man's contribution to environmental ""pollution"" are paltry compared to those 
of nature. In her exceptional book TRASHING THE PLANET, former Atomic Energy 
Commision Chairman Dr. Dixie Lee Ray notes based on the available data, ""all 
of the air polluting materials produced by man since the beginning of the 
industrial revolution do not begin to equal  the quantities of toxic 
materials, aerosols, and particulates spewed into the air from just three 
volcanoes: Krakatoa in Indonesia in 1883, Mount Katmai in Alaska in 1912, and 
Hekla in Iceland in 1947."" To which could be added Mount St. Helens in 
Washington State in 1980 (which pumped out 910,000 metric tons of carbon 
dioxide alone). El Chicon in Mexico in 1982 (which sent more than 100 million 
tons of sulfur gases into the stratosphere), and Mount Pinatubo in the 
Philippines (which in 1991 hurled upwards of 30 million tons of material into 
the stratosphere).
LOS NINOS
Many environmentalists attributed the 1988 drought in the U.S. to global 
warming, but researchers with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in 
Boulder Colorado reported that the freakish weather was actually due to a 
natural phenomenon, the interaction of El Nino and El Nina, two massive 
currents in the tropical Pacific. El Nino is a huge strip of warm water that 
periodically appears off the coast of South America and disrupts the world's 
weather patterns. Now and then, it alternates with El Nina, a mass of cold 
water that comes from the ocean depths along the equator and drifts for 
thousands of miles.
CHICAGO TRIBUNE'S  Peter Gorner summarized the phenomenon: ""Cold water along 
the equator clashed with warmer than normal water southeast of Hawaii. The 
result was both the U.S. drought and the devastating floods that swamped 
Bangladesh...... Nina's cooler water disrupted tropical weather patterns and 
distorted the path of the Jet Stream across North America. Then the Jet 
Stream shoved rain-producing weather systems away from the interior of the 
U.S. resulting in drought.""
TERMITE TERROR

Sundry animals and insects also contribute their share to environmental 
""degradation. TIME for April 20,1992 noted that in ""the Netherlands... manure 
from pigs poses a major ecological threat, defiling water supplies with 
excessive nitrites and acidifying local soils. Sheep have permanently scarred 
the landscape in Spain and Portugal, while in India ... bovines [cows] are 
ravenous wraiths whose constant quest  for food drives them to ravage 
standing forrests.""
The February 1983 issue  of SCIENCE DIGEST reported that ""an international 
team of researchers has discovered that termites generate more than twice the 
Carbon Dioxide  that fuel burning does."" According to a study reported in 
SCIENCE for November 5, 1982, the ""estimated gross amount of Carbon Dioxide 
produced [by termites] was more than twice the net global input from fossil 
fuel combustion."" In addition, ""Termites are a potentially important source 
of atmospheric methane: they could account for a large fraction of global 
emmisions."" The wood-eating pests have a bacteria that enables them too 
digest carbon so efficiently that some 90 pe is converted too Carbon Dioxide, 
methane, and other gases they belch into the atmosphere.
Ants are another natural source of ""pollution."" In 1987, an atmospheric 
chemist with Bell Laboratories, and zoologists from Cornell University, 
reported that ants of the subfamily FORMICINAE make and store huge quantities 
of the formic acid that contributes most of the acidity of rain that falls in 
remote areas and is found in atmosphere gas and precepitation around the 
globe. It is abundant, for instance, in the fog and mists that hang over the 
rain forests of Central Africa. According to the July 6, 1987 INSIGHT 
magazine, the ""ants release the acid when defending themselves and 
communicating with each other and upon dying. Since  30 percent of the world 
ant population belongs to this subfamily, there is significant concern about  
the acid the ants release,"" an amount estimated at ""600,000 metric tons 
annually."" which is equal to the combined formic acid contributions of 
automobiles, refuse combustion and vegetation.""
Clearly, man has a long way to go to match nature as a ""despoiler"" of the 
environment.

Is this an arguement against or for?  Or simply a statement of agreeance/

mean that homosexuals are immoral and more liable to commit crime.  And one
must remember that prison is not necessarily a reflection of the type of
people who are criminals.  What are the statistics for unsolved crime?

I must object to the characterization of those opposed to the
government's handling of the Waco situation as ""gun supporters"".
Your argument tries to paint the BATF critics as right-wing
gun nuts, and just mixes up two issues.

I am one of the BATF/FBI critics, and yet I am a liberal
and just as anti-gun as you are.  I just happen to believe
that everyone has civil rights, even religious crazies.
They're all human beings, not some nest of wasps that
you're trying to exterminate.

The BATF created the crisis situation by the way they handled
the original raid.  It was well known that Koresh regularly
went jogging outside his property.  He could have been served
with a search warrant then.  He could have been arrested if
he had refused to comply.  Instead officers armed with grenades
invaded the property.  This escalated into a shooting war
with tragic deaths on both sides.

Those were the first two mistakes:  the bad judgment of
asking for a no-knock warrant, and the bad and probably
illegal way the already-unwise warrant was served.

At this point, the situation escalated to where it was
described as an armed standoff and a hostage crisis.
That's when the government started covering their traces,
sealing the warrant, revising their reported history of
the incident, etc.

Things were already building up to disaster.  Now the
government could have simply closed the supply routes
and waited.  But according to Janet Reno, that option
had ""never been seriously considered"".  So, supposedly
because the agents were ""frustrated and fatigued"", and
because there supposedly were no backups, they felt
they had to go in.

Now it's entirely possible that Koresh was responsible
for the fire.  If that's so, he deserves the blame
for the deaths of the people in his compound.

But the government's hands are far from clean.
Their first raid demonstrated bad judgment plus
contempt for the 4th amendment.  The motivations
for the second raid are just too unbelievable.
And their coverup of the events of the first
raid undermines their credibility in anything
they do thereafter.  We have only some very
biased FBI agents' word for what happened.

And please let's not turn this into a pro-gun vs. anti-gun
discussion.  Anti-gun people do not believe that gun-owners
deserve to get frontally assaulted by armed government
agents.  And Koresh's civil rights exist whether his
guns were legal, illegal, illegal-but-should-have-been-legal,
or whatever!

Gosh, I have to associate with heterosexuals against my will every day! 
That means you've imposed your moral codes on me, now doesn't it? 
Fortunately, I have taken the time to get to know some members
of the het community and discovered that, hey!  They really AREN'T all evil
elitists with no concept of reality!

I've got a few clues for you.  (a) I'm not working to pass any laws.  (b)
Our morals are YOUR morals: I imagine you value freedom.  So do we.  If you
value your own freedom, you must necessarily accept that these laws are
important to protect it.  After all, discriminate in one area and you're
open to discriminate in the rest.  (c) I suggest learning a bit more about
gays, lesbians, and bis before you post the kind of drivel you have been.

As things get more and more miserable inside, one of two things is

The thing to remember about (2) is that hysterical situations and ""assults""

Is anyone out there knowledgeable on drug issues in Japan?  I'm interested
in knowing if Japan has or has ever had a problem with drugs, and how they
dealt with it.  I've heard, undocumented, that Japan years ago used heavy
legal penalties to end a serious heroin problem.  I'd like to know both
sides of the story.  Does anyone recall such a problem?  What were laws
at the time relating to drug use, drug dealing, and drug trafficking?  What
are the laws now?  What other anti-drug measures, like education and treatment
has Japan used?  How are drugs regarded by the Japanese people?  How effective
have anti-drug measures been in Japan?  Thanks for your help.

I wouldn't worry too much about it, though.  We are starting to find
out how politically impotent homosexuals really are.  The Colorado
boycott has fizzled, Slick Willie was effectively prevented from
implementing his military policy wrt homosexuals by members of his
_OWN_ party, this new study casts a large shadow of doubt on their
claims of large numbers, and coming this Saturday they are going to
wind up with _TREMENDOUS_ egg on their face when, I submit, no more
than perhaps 35,000 queers will show up in Washington while they are
promising crowds in the millions.  And most of the ones who will be
there will look like ACT-UP and Queer Nation, not the guy working in
the next cubicle.  As if that's really going to play in middle
America.

Pretty soon they will find themselves retreating back into the closet
where they belong.

I think the big mistake in that study must be that if one had had no sexual

Even if they didn't intend it that way, that's how the figures are being used.

You miss the point.  A lot more negotiation is needed to convince women
to have sex because there is a big taboo about women being free with 
their sex.  Many of the women I know would do almost anything rather
than be known as a slag, slut or whore.

With men however there is *status* attached to being able to fuck 
constantly.  And with gay men, where both partners can prove status
through their constant verility then you are going to get a situation
where there is a lot of sex.

The difference is between het sex being rationed as a valuable commodity
and gay sex being virtually unlimited due to the *appetites* of men.

Straights suffer a bottle neck where women are concerned, gay men who
do not experience this bottle neck go to excess.

The Earth may spew alot of substances into the atmosphere, but the quality

the planet is a system of carbon, sulfur and other chemicals which have been

  True.  Today's Boston Globe interviewed a former Unification Church
  leader who is now a consultant on cults.  He said the FBI's approach
  was totally wrong.  He said they should have tried to break down the 
  BD's loyalty to Koresh through psychological means.   Koresh's whole
  theology was based on an approaching confrontation with the forces 
  of evil in the world and a seige mentality based on this.  The Feds
  played into his hands **PERFECTLY**.   By surrounding the compound
  with tanks and playing loud rock music and glaring lights at them 
  they strongly reinforced Koresh's message that the outside world was
  evil and threatening.    He said instead they should have set up 
  a picnic atmosphere, and acted inviting and friendly.  If they
  broadcast anything over PA systems it should have been loving 
  relatives reflecting on pleasant events from the cult members'
  childhoods.   The idea is to make the outside world and surrender
  seem like a pleasant, desirable alternative.   Interesting comments.

OK, never heard of Cross filters, but Roberts, Prewitt and Sobel filters
are standard spatial masks for edge detection.  Highpass filtering does a
good job of detecting edges, too.  A good reference for all sorts of general
digital image processing is the book _Digital Image Processing_ by

Greetings this is a general call for information regarding Image
Processing. I am looking for any material related to the field, and am
also trying to get my hands on some easy to use packages related to the
field. In particular source code for general use packages.

I already have several texts on the subject, but would appreciate more
input from people more knowledgable in the field than myself. I'm not
mathematically literate (ie. I don't have a degree in mathematics), so
any material that is suggested I would prefer that it was not
mathematically intensive.

The best book I have found on the subject at the moment is:

""Practical Digital Image Processing""
by Rhys Lewis
ISBN: 0-13-683525-2
Published by Ellis Horwood (c)1990.

Likewise I am trying to get a fair sample of programs that demonstrate
Image Processing techniques. So far I have 'xv', and 'khoros' for Unix.
'Dcview 2.1' for the IBM PC, and various related smatterings of C code
to help describe topics like, contrasting, dithering, image enhancement
via convolution etc.

If anyone could kindly supply me with some public domain software
pertinent to this area, or better still if they could tell me where I am
most likely to find it on the AARNET (Internet). If I can I would prefer
source code in C or Turbo Pascal that includes some Image Processing
code/algorithms, that I can readily alter/manipulate for the purposes of
demonstration it would be most helpful.

All the above information will contribute to my post-graduate studies,
and will be liberally used in my paper, and seminar on the subject.

The April 1993 edition of MIX Magazine carries a story on 3DO which
includes pictures of the unit, a schematic of what's inside and some
indication from the people at 3DO as to where they intend to go and in
what stages. (MIX is a trade rag aimed at the professional sound
engineering community.)

The schematic shows a central DMA Engine connecting and mediating between
two Graphics Animation processors (32 bit bus), a 32-bit RISC processor
with math co-processor, Video Decomp module, a control port, an expansion
port (where 3DO hangs its double-fast CD player), 1Mb DRAM, an optional
video port (for editing video) and on the outbound side 1MB VRAM to Video
Processor to TV chain parallel with a DSP to sound chain. 

They promise Red Book CD-quality audio, full 30 fps video and a future
connection path to your PC via a PC expansion card.

I am not informed enough to have an opinion about the various means and
methods discussed here. The article, written by Philip De Lancie, does
cover the other machines mentioned in this thread.  I come from the PC
TCP/IP world and see a tremendous potential for bringing connectedness to
the educated consumer; 3DO seems to have the right business partners to
make this happen. 

Hope this helps.

Subject: Monthly LightWave mailing list FAQ
Lines: 130


----------------------   LightWave3D Mail-List   ----------------------

-- WHAT IS LightWave? --

LightWave3D is part of a suite of programs that come bundled with a
device called the ""Toaster"" (from NewTek, Inc.) that operates on an
Amiga platform.  The LightWave software (LightWave=LightWave3D and
LightWave Modeler) allows and artist to create three dimensional
photo-realistic images for a variety of purposes.

-- WHY ARE WE DOING THIS? --

This mailing list is for those interested in the LightWave software, how
it operates and in ideas on how to obtain the best quality images
available to them.  The list is for those who own the Toaster and
LightWave as well as those just interested in what can be done with the
package.  We hope to share information, tips, procedures and to bond as
a group.

-- WHAT ARE THE RULES? --

Since LightWave/Modeler are just a part of the Newtek Video Toaster
software, I'm sure we will discuss a few items related to the operation
of the Toaster.  However, we will strive to keep the subject revolving
specifically around the 3D software, related tools and products.

You do NOT have to own a Toaster to join this list!

-- OK! HOW DO I JOIN? --

To become a member of the LightWave3D mailing list you must send a mail
message to the address:

        lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com

In the body of the message enter:

subscribe lightwave-l your.name@your.site.domain

Or just ask to be signed up and I will sign you up to the list.  At this
point in time the process is manual but I hope to get an automated
script based system in place soon.  There shouldn't be too much of a
delay in joining.  Expect a ""welcome"" message within 5 days after you
send your request.  Then, expect the mail to start flowing in!

-- HOW DO I POST TO THE LIST? --

Contributing to the list is simple.  Just mail your articles to the
following address:

        lightwave@bobsbox.rent.com

Your article will be processed by the system and distributed to all
others joined to the list.  Your articles will also be sent to you so
you know that your article has made it to the list.  However, those
addresses that are either no good or no longer active will bounce back
to you.  So, if you post an article and another members address is no
longer valid, your original article will be returned to you.  This
doesn't mean it hasn't been posted to the list.  In fact, just the
opposite is true. It means that your article WAS posted and that it
couldn't be sent to one or more of the members of the list due to a bad
address.

NOTE: I hope to have a fix for this behavior soon.

-- HOW DO I QUIT THE LIST? --

Simply mail a request to be removed from the list to the same address
you used to sign up:

        lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com

In the body of the message enter:

unsubscribe LightWave-l your.name@your.site.domain

I will remove your name from the list of members.  PLEASE, if you join
the list and your account is going to be closed or if you will not be
able to receive mail for a while, send a request to be removed from the
list!  If you are just going to lose access for a short while still send
a request for a suspension of your membership and I will suspend
forwarding of the articles to you.


-- WHAT ABOUT OLD ARTICLES? --

I am currently archiving all the articles posted to the list at the
originating site (bobsbox).  However, I can not continue to do this due
to lack of disk space.  What we need is a volunteer that will maintain a
compendium of articles sent to the list.  They can compress and store
them in archives on their system.  They can then periodically post an
index of the contents of the compendium and any other information that
relates.

Has anyone seen hallusions?  You can buy a poster of them and it looks like a simple dot pattern
when you first look at it but if you focus behind it you see a 3d picture.  I'm looking for
a program that generates these pictures.  There's a company in Texas that makes them but I 
doubt if they're giving the program away.  Any help would be appreciated.

My wife wants to publish a newsletter. She's no artist, so she intends to
use comercial clipart and customise it a bit by drawing a circle or a box
around it etc. 
 
We have MSPublisher for manipulating text, but it is not suitable for doing
much with graphics, so she needs a more specialised tool. Right now she's
looking at Corel Draw and Harvard Draw. There seem to be more books in the
stores on Corel than on Harvard, so she's inclined to go with Corel on the
basis of popularity. Can anyone give us an informed opinion on which 
package would be more suitable or if there is an even better alternative
available? If this is a FAQ, please withhold the flames and just send the
location of the FAQ document. Thanks.
 
Three PS's:
 
1) Is it ok to use clip art from Harvard Draw or whatever for commercial
   purposes?
 
2) We have a 600 dpi Laser Jet 4 printer. What would be a good scanner for
   reading in paper clipart?
 
3) How about someone starting up a newsgroup on desktop publishing if one
   doesn't exist?

This image is copyrighted. Early in another news group it was being
used as a texture map in a planet orbiting simulation. That program
was being freely distributed but the texture map picture for the

Does anyone have any real experience with the Kubota Kenai/Denali
series of graphics workstations?  They pretty much blow the pants
off SGI machines and Sun machines in the same price point, which
is about 50,000 bucks.  Real nice stuff, but I've only seen the

Hi there,

I'm looking for help on hi-rez CGA modes (hey, i know it sounds crazy but at

640 by 400 2 colour and 640 by 200 4 colour (the card has 64k memory). Could 
anyone give me some help on how to implement these modes (Assembly language 
is fine). Any other usefull tips on the CGA regs will also help.

Subject: Tangent vectors of Kochanek-Bartels splines
Organization: University of Trondheim
Lines: 33

I'm working on a system which uses a given set of 3D key frame
positions (x,y,z) to control an imaginary camera movement.  I'm
using Kochanek-Bartels splines (as described in the SIGGRAPH '84
proceedings) to create a variable number of inbetweens between
the key frames.  I want the inbetweens to be given in the form
(x,y,z,dx,dy,dz) where the last three argumentsa are the x, y and
z component of the viewing direction vector of the camera when
positioned at (x,y,z).

The method presented by Kochanek and Bartels only deals with the
positions of the inbetween view points to be generated.  I've
tried to set the viewing direction at a view point equal to the
chord between the two adjacent view points (which in general are
not key frames), but this causes a sligt discontinuity of the
viewing direction vector at the key frame positions (although
the spatial movement seems to work fine; and I'm quite certain
- I think :) - that I've not simply made an implementation
error...)

Now I wonder if anyone out there has used this spline form for
similar purposes and how they decided the viewing vectors.
I'd appreciate replies to be emailed to me at
  iharkest@lise.unit.no
Anyone else interested in the answer will be sent a summary of
the replies if they contact me.

According to the literature, it will do quadruple buffering so that you

                FIRST ANNUAL PHIGS USER GROUP CONFERENCE

          The First Annual PHIGS User Group Conference was held March 21-24
          in Orlando, Florida.  The conference was organized by the Rensse-
          laer Design Research Center in co-operation with  IEEE  and  SIG-
          GRAPH.   Attendees  came  from five countries spanning three con-
          tinents.   A  good  cross-section  of  the  PHIGS  community  was
          represented  at this conference with participants including PHIGS
          users, workstation vendors, third-party PHIGS implementors, stan-
          dards  committee  members,  and  researchers  from  industry  and
          academia.  The opening speaker, Dr. Richard Puk, challenged PHIGS
          users  to  ""take  charge of your PHIGS"" by participating in PHIGS
          standardization activities and communicating their needs to PHIGS
          implementors.    The   closing  speaker,  Dr.  Andries  Van  Dam,
          described his vision of the future of graphics standards  ""beyond
          PHIGS"".

          Technical paper sessions in the conference covered the  following
          topics:  PHIGS  and  X, Application Toolkits, Application Issues,
          Texture Mapping, NURBS,  PHIGS  Extensions,  and  Object-Oriented
          Libraries and Frameworks.  Panel sessions on PHIGS and PEX, PHIGS
          Non-Retained Data, Real-World CAD Applications Using  PHIGS,  and
          Portability  Issues generated enthusiastic discussions and formed
          a good forum for exchange of ideas, needs, and experiences.   The
          conference  also included a day full of tutorials on topics rang-
          ing from mathematics for 3D  graphics  to  object-oriented  tools
          based on PHIGS.

          Next year's conference is planned for March, 1994.

          PHIGS EVERYWHERE

          At the conference, PHIGS  vendors   described   and  demonstrated
          PHIGS  products  that  run on all types of computers, from PCs to
          mainframes.

          Megatek Corporation demonstrated their PHIGS extensions including
          conditional traversal, composite logical input devices, texturing
          and translucency.

          Template Graphics  Software  launched  FIGARO+  PRO,  the  Photo-
          Realistic  Option  for  PHIGS+.  FIGARO+  PRO  is designed to add
          advanced rendering to the existing PHIGS+ API, with features like
          ray   tracing,  materials,  anti-aliasing  and  texture  mapping.
          Radiosity support is also planned.

          FIGARO+ is an example of how TGS continues to add newly  emerging
          graphics  features to their products.  FIGARO+ supports immediate
          mode extensions to PHIGS and also supports SUN XGL,  HP  Starbase
          and SGI GL/OpenGL. FIGARO+ for NT will be released this summer.

          TGS also demonstrated the latest versions of FIGraph, a  powerful
          ""2-call""  charting  system  based on PHIGS+, and FIGt, an object-
          oriented utility library for PHIGS/PEX developers.

          G5G and Gallium Software demonstrated a new version of GPHIGS  on
          Silicon  Graphics  workstations. Scheduled for summer, 1993, Ver-
          sion 3.0 of GPHIGS, the company's  PHIGS+  library  for  worksta-
          tions,  will include an advanced PHIGS debugger that allows PHIGS
          developers to display and browse PHIGS structures and other PHIGS
          internal  state.  G5G  also  described  their Non-Duplicated Data
          Store that stores pointers to application data in the GPHIGS  CSS
          for  more  efficient  use  of  memory. In addition, G5G described
          their application GSE that allows application callback  functions
          during  GPHIGS traversal.  GPHIGS and PHIGURE, G5G's data visual-
          izer and application development toolkit, are currently available
          on  all  major  workstations  that support GL, X Windows, PEX, or
          Starbase.

          Wise Software presented a slide show of  Z-PHIGS  for  MS-Windows
          and ARENA, a PHIGS based modeller/render. Z-PHIGS implements most
          of the PHIGS+ primitives.  In addition Z-PHIGS has built in  many
          advanced  rendering features like texture mapping, shadow genera-
          tion, area quick updates and ray tracing. A demo disk of  Z-PHIGS
          or ARENA is available on request.

          ATC exhibited GRAFPAK-PHIGS, their full-featured PHIGS  implemen-
          tation  based  on  DEC  PHIGS. GRAFPAK-PHIGS is available on most
          workstation platforms with C, FORTRAN and Ada bindings and incor-
          porates PEX support.

          Within the booth sponsored by Advanced Technology Center, Digital
          Equipment  Corporation demonstrated DEC PHIGS V2.4 running on the
          DEC 3000/400 AXP PXG. ATCs' GRAFPAK-PHIGS is a port of DEC PHIGS.
          DEC  PHIGS  V2.4 contains most PHIGS and PHIGS PLUS features with
          support for PEX V5.1  protocol.  DEC  PHIGS  also  contains  most
          GM/EDS   PHIGS  extensions  including  post-to-view  as  well  as
          proprietary extensions to support immediate  mode  rendering  and
          the use of PHIGS in an X11 environment.

Significant progress has been made recently in shape analysis using
neural networks and the energy minimization concept. Ablex Publishing
Corporation is planning a special volume on ""Shape Analysis"", scheduled
for this year.

This volume will be a part of ""Progress in Neural Networks,"" an annual
book series reviewing research in modelling, analysis, design and
application of neural networks. The primary aim of this volume is to
present, in a single volume, the most important achievements made on
this important topic, which are otherwise scattered in diverse literature.

Authors are invited to submit original manuscripts detailing recent
progress. Suggested topics include, but are not limited to: shape modelling,
shape estimation, shape recovery, shape representation, shape matching,
surface reconstruction and surface decomposition. Research work utilizing
neural networks directly or based on energy minimization techniques such as
Markov random field, mean field annealing, simulated annealing, graduated
non-convexity algorithms and resistive networks are most welcome.

The paper should be tutorial in nature, self contained and preferably,
but not necessarily, about fifty double spaced pages in length. Please send

I guess I edited my note on this away from the article I posted to
many newsgroups.

I wrote something about making color modifications quickly
with 8bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file
process we have to make the modifications to the 24bit image.
This makes sense, because the main use of XV is only viewing images.

Doing many changes to image, we should keep all modifications
in a buffer; and then before making the operations to 24bit image,
we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations.

Never claimed it is a bug.
I tried kept sure I don't claim that JPEG is noting else than
a compression algorithm, because I know what the JPEG is.
(You propably misunderstood what I wrote as you have done in many
places so far.)

You also missed what is (were) wrong with XV. However, I did wrote it.

Certainly. Reference follows. 

Bear in mind that there are at least two conditions which may be called
red/green colour blind. One, protanopia, is caused by a lack or major
dysfunction of the L cones, those that respond best to long
wavelengths. This gives much reduced red/green and red/violet discrimination and
also means that reds look dimmer than than they do to people with normal vision.

The other, deuteranopia, is due to missing or dysfunctional M cones although it
can also be caused by a lack of the L-M cone difference signals in the retina.
It also gives reduced red/green discrimination but red/violet is unaffected. 
Unlike protanopia, reds are not dimmer than  normal.

On a uniform chromaticity diagram - the horseshoe shaped one you see in computer
graphics books - there is a single confusion point for each type of colour
deficiency. Colours which are confused lie on straight lines radiating from this
point. For protanopia the point is at u'=0.61,v'=0.51, very close to the far red
corner. For deuteranopia, the point is at u'=-4.75, v'=1.31

Note that different experimental investigations in the literature give slightly
different values for these depending on the precise details of the experimental
setup, random errors, and so on. The values quoted are typical.

So if all colours on a line are seen as the same, which colour is actually seen?

This problem has now been solved. Tests on people with one normal eye and one
affected eye have shown that there is an axis for each type of disorder onto
which all the colours collapse. For protanopes this joins up 473nm and 574nm on
the spectral locus (the edge of the horseshoe); for deuteranopes the line is
very similar,  joining 477nm and 579nm.

*So* to convert colours from normal vision to a simulated protanopia or
duuteranopia:

1) Plot the colour on a uniform chromaticity diagram
2) Construct a line from this point to the appropriate confusion point
3) Find the intersection of this line with the appropriate axis line
4) This is the new chromaticity. 

The best reference for this is Meyer, G.W. & Greenberg, D.P. (1988) 'Colour
defective vision and computer graphics displays', IEEE Computer Graphics and
Applications 8(5) 28-40.

You will also need a decent reference on basic colour science if you are not
familiar with the CIE XYZ colour model and the uniform chromaticity scale diagram.

>I would like to write a program (probably a PPM filter) to allow

>blind users. Not being colour blind myself, this is a bit difficult!

Yes this is certainly possible. You will need the chromaticities of the red
green and blue phosphors of the monitor you intend to display the images on, and
the chromaticity of the white point. This information can be measured, or
obtained from the manufacturer. I posted a list of some monitor chromaticities a
couple of weeks ago.

The procedure, for each pixel (!) is as follows. (Some lookup tables might be a
help here.)

A) convert RGB to CIE XYZ. This is a simple 3*3 matrix multiplication once you
have the monitor data.
B) retaining the Y component for later, convert XYZ to chromaticity coordinates u'v'
using u' = 4X/(X+15Y+3Z), v' = 9Y/(X+15Y+3Z)
C) find the equation of the line as in step 2 above
D) find the intersection as in step 3
E) convert back from u'v' to XYZ, using the Y value from step A
F) Ensure that this new colour can be displayed on your monitor; if not, move it
along a line in XYZ space towards neutral grey (ie half way between black and
white) until it is displayable.

Or alternatively, 75% of the questions cover 10% of the topics in this group -
making them frequently asked.

So the other 25% cover 90% of the topics, making them rarely asked and thus in
sore need of answering ...

Think about what you are saying here. The 24 bit image is quantised down to 8
bits so many 'similar' colours are mapped onto a single palette colour. This
colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways. You then want to apply these
modifications back to the 24 bit file, so you have to find which colours mapped
to this one palette colour. Ok you could do this by copying the 24 bit file to a
32 bit file and using the extra 8 bits to hold the index entry. 
Having done this, you need to do something to them ... what, exactly?

Apply the difference in RGB between the original and modified palette entry to
each colour in the group? This could generate colours with RGB outside the range
0...255. It would also lead to discontinuities when different parts of a smooth
colour gradient mapped to several different palette entries.

You could interpolate from full modification to no modification depending how
far each colour was from the palette entry. However I suspect this would look
rather odd.

So in summary, what I said in my previous posting still holds:

>>How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How
>>would you group 'related' colours to edit them together? Only global
>>changes could be done unless the software were very different and
>>much more complicated.

>>If you want to do colour editing on a 24 bit image, you need much
>>more powerfull software - which is readily available commercially.

In other words, to edit a 24 bit file you need software built for the job.
Tacking mods onto xv is going to create more problems than it solves.

As to the other bits - you seemed to be claiming that there were bugs in XV. If
that was not what you meant, then:

>(You propably misunderstood what I wrote as you have done in many
>places so far.)

Yes, I probably did. I found that the collected digest format of your posting
made it a little difficult to understand precisely what your point was. Sorry
if I misunderstood.

>You also missed what is (were) wrong with XV. However, I did wrote it.

Yes again. What *is* (was?) wrong with xv?

I suppose you don't know what about we have discussed.
We discussed about error(s) in XV 2.21 which shows images only as 8bit,
and my suggestion above works perfectly with it.

So far I have seen a colormap editing window in XV -- that is, there
must be a colormap anyway. The problems you present are exist anyway,
and I didn't tried to solve them at all, because I would not make such
problems to my programs in the first place.

Gamma and color corrections are easily done to 24bit image
as I presented. There's no need make tricks from 8bit/quantized image
back to 24 bit image.


>>>How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How
>>>would you group 'related' colours to edit them together? Only global
>>>changes could be done unless the software were very different and
>>>much more complicated.

Ok, you're writing about situation that user want edit images as 24bit
and user want edit individual colors -- your questions, by the way,
jumps off the discussion a bit.

My solution doesn't work, because there's no colormap withing real 24bit
image -- you see, user see 24bit image; going back to 8bit is silly.


About changing individual colors in 8bit/quantized/rasterized image:
changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most
cases if the image is quantized and rasterized -- small change may
make serious errors to anywhere in the image.
XV allows this feature, but I don't recommend to use it with the
mentioned type images.

Moreover, XV is not a paint program; you can only make those global
changes. In full 24bit XV, changing individual colors sounds like
paint program job.
If person have 8bit screen, there's need for tricks to get the
original 24bit image modified. Because user don't see full 24bit
image, there's need to make approximations and it is not possible to
modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups (if
image is rasterized). To select indiavidual color, there could be 7x7
cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area --
selecting individual color is possible from that.

Ok, I don't have thought very much 24bit painting programs, never seen
such in good view and are not planned to make such. Not to mention
24bit painting program in 8bit screen...


>Yes again. What *is* (was?) wrong with xv?

It saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs; jpeg is not
designed for that.
Also, human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image; say,
person would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is
expected that the image still is the same. So, XV were designed
without thinking about human interface and how human expect the
program work -- design error.

I have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, but
it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making
major change to the original design.

So, even all screen images are 8bit, the processed images and saved
images could have been 24bit very easily, instead of 8bit.

Before anybody will make a note: yes, I may as well make a lift where
'up' means that the lift goes down and 'down' means that the lift goes
up, and put a note on this design solution to the manuals -- however,
even the manuals tells the correct situation, it doesn't solve the problem.
(Americans: the lift is just an example :)


Well, my text may be a bit hard reading, hopefully you suggeeded to
read it.

You can use PBM's 'rawtopgm' to convert three raw (r, g, b) files to pgm format. Then you can use pgm3toppm to convert the pgm files to a composite ppm file,
and feed this to cjpeg for compression. Slow, and circuitous, but it will

Subject: Full Color Image Editor for SGI Workstations
Organization: University of Houston

   I am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program,
   an INTERACTIVE, FULL COLOR image viewer and editor based on SGI GL.
   Besides typical touchup tasks, such as crop, rotate, smooth, etc,
   bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs,
   such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image.

   The following is the relevant sections from the man page. 
   -----------------------------------------------------------------

Pre-Release of May, 1993                                       BIT(1L)

NAME
   bit - Bitmap Image Touchup for SGI Workstations

DESCRIPTION
  bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on
  Silicon Graphics GL. As a full color program, bit handles images of both
  24bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner.

  As an image viewer, bit allows list of images to be displayed in their
  original type (24bits or color index) in any order and in any of the
  many built-in styles of display. You can walk up and down the list using
  mouse and keyboard, or you can let bit do the walk for you (The
  SlideShow).  With the pan and zoom features, large images can be viewed
  in full without being limited by the window or screen size.

  As an image editor, bit performs a large number of image editing and
  processing tasks accurately and efficiently. It keeps information loss
  at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing
  subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type
  whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and/or quantization of
  input images. You can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into
  another.  In addition, arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple
  geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with
  the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take
  advantage of the higher printer resolutions (e.g. PostScript).

  Bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing
  image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence
  turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be
  accessed by a press of a button, and best of all, the processed image
  will be read back and displayed immediately. Convolution using exter-
  nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically
  giving great flexibility in processing an image.

FEATURES

  Bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a
  continuous progress report, and once the processing is complete, 
  the processed image will be displayed.

  Current features include

  o Rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti-aliasing
    and filling the ""rotated out"" region with an arbitrary color.

  o Scales an image by arbitrary factors in x- and/or y-directions with
    the option of subpixel sampling.

  o Renders text of arbitrary color, size or orientation on top of an
    image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving
    the text and raster separately, such as into a PostScript file, to
    take advantage of a higher printer resolution. Besides normal text
    strings, many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as
    in TeX(1), e.g., $\alpha$\small$\beta$ produces Greek alphabet alpha
    followed by a slightly smaller Greek alphabet beta.

  o Presents graphically the histogram of an image.

  o Performs arbitrary 1-to-1 pixel transformation.  The transformation
    function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary
    forms. Further, the transformation can be applied to RGB channels
    separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of
    it. Many difficult tasks, such as thresholding, can be accomplished
    rather easily by 1-to-1 transformation in combination with the avai-
    lability of graphical histograms of the image.

  o Places simple geometric figures (SGFs), e.g., arrows, circles, trian-
    gles etc., of arbitrary color, size and orientation into an image at
    arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some
    user definable coordinate system units, with the option of rendering
    directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately (e.g,
    PostScript file). All SGFs can be scaled in x- and y-directions
    independently or simultaneously (this is how to get an ellipse from a
    circle).

  o Performs edge detection. In combination with image histograms and 1-
    to-1 transformation, very accurate result can be obtained.

  o Performs histogram equalization.

  o Performs convolution with externally defined (square) matrices of
    arbitrary order.

  o Crops a rectangular portion of an image.

  o Cuts and pastes across images.

  o Magnifies any portion of an image by any amount.

  o Displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause
    interval between images. (SlideShow)

  o Measures RGB intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels
    along an arbitrary line with the result presented as RGB intensities
    or as an intensity vs. distance plot.

  o Performs image type conversions.

  o Converts image formats.

  o Smoothes an image (Special convolution).

  o Filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image
    back and display it.

  o Modify an individual pixel's RGB values.

  o Performs FFT on the entire image or a portion of it and display the
    resulting power spectra.

  o Spray and brush paint in full color (unavailable in this pre-release).

 SUPPORTED FORMATS
      o  IRIS RGB, native to SGI IRIS
      o  JPEG(JFIF) format
      o  CompuServ GIF
      o  PNM(Portable Any Map), including PPM, PGM and PBM.
      o  XBM (X Window Bitmap)
      o  TIFF
      o  PostScript(Write only)

Hardware requirements:
---------------------------------------------------------------
   Any SGI workstation that supports RGBmode(), including indigoes.

Where to get it:
---------------------------------------------------------------
   anonymous ftp to monte.svec.uh.edu   /pub/bit/bitxxx.tar.Z
   where xxx is the version number. Current version is 0.73

   Read src/01Readme for installation instructions after unpacking

Acknowledgement:
---------------------------------------------------------------
   JPEG support is based on the Independent JPEG groups's library Version 4.
   FORMS library, developed by Mark Overmars, is used for GUI.
   Both JPEG and FORMS library are included in this release.

  Bit is the program you will ever need to view and annotate
  images; The built-in editing features will satisfy most of
  your editing needs. In addition, the external filter and dynamical
  kernel will utilize any program you already have. So try it
  (and you will like it).
  
  As always, any comments/bug reports are welcome.

""Only""?!?  That's a long time! (echoing above posting)  The way the market

Sounds like you'll have to sink *some* money into it for repair, but
that's sometimes necessary for equipment.

I think 21 months with nothing wrong until now is quite reasonable.  If
you had bought a Compaq or Toshiba, you might have reasonably expected the
machine to last longer before something went wrong; but that's a moot
point, perhaps.

I worked in support for a while at a company and we had problems with several
Toshiba 1600's in a short space of time. They were all around 2 years old.
Some screens went completely (as above), others were just ""dodgy"".

This happened to about 5 or 6 out of, maybe 100. They were fairly reliable up
to then and I don't think it was a special problem with Tosh's (no link to the
company). So I would think that 21 months may not be unreasonable - just
unlucky!

I can see XV-3.00 agree with my view in cases you don't -- even I say
my personal opinion (as above), it doesn't mean that it is not most
obvious thing.
Please, if you use my previous writings as contradicting argument,
please do read them -- you have not saw them at all; you just
refered to text from which I wrote 'something' -- and you make
hard decisions from that, without reading what exactly I have written.

It is really hard read when one writes a reply line by line method
and don't understand include previously written material with the new
sentences to give them meaning. You seem to be one such.

You also start replying to my articles, even you don't understand what
is going on; you ask me repeatedly to decsribe my views what were
wrong with XV 2.21 even I posted them within the article you did reply
to. Believe me, it is not nice to get flamed specially when I know
that you have not read my article carefully in the first place.

XV-3.00 and JPEG FAQ and users I have written to agree me with the
places you didn't; I'm sure you just didn't undertand what about I
wrote. We can blame my writing skills (in English?) for that, or?

Better stop the discussion and check what new ideas XV-3.00 gives;
I allready mailed one to Bradley...

Since this was posted on comp.ai, I assume there is an AI angle to this.  Hacking is
what AI students do when they're really supposed to be doing something else, e.g.
thesis research & write up, getting their supervisors' pet programs to run properly,
etc.  No-one gets much glory for hacking, and no-one gets any money out of it.
Producing good free software requires an enormous investment of time & resources that
not many people can, or want to, afford - particularly during a recession.

In addition, over the last 10 years, I think there has been a de-emphasis on producing
running programs in AI research, and a greater emphasis on more formal approaches to
problem-solving.  Students have been proving theorems instead of writing programs.
At a conference a year or two ago, Johann de Kleer suggested that everyone should
'Get back to the keyboard' and write more programs that demonstrate their ideas -
and I have to say I'm inclined to agree.

(I don't claim to be a superhacker, but I don't think that invalidates my remarks.
And I'm sure this isn't the whole story.)

Actually, IFF is a *format standard*.  It is not a picture file format, sound
file format, but there exist several formats that use the IFF standard.  The
IFF picture standard used by mostly everybody is a FORM ILBM (or just ILBM).
The only 3D IFF specification I know of is TDDD, which is used by Imagine and
it's predecessor, Turbo Silver.   It is possible that some of the other Amiga
packages use another *IFF* spec, but I don't know of any.  Lightwave will load
TDDD FORM's I believe.

On a more cheerful note, perhaps hackerism/hacking isn't completely dead.

As someone else said, take the GNU offerings for example - free, redistributable and 
often better than the commercial stuff.  Take also the number of papers published
every year in all the fields of computer science - the vast majority of these papers
detail original work of real, often exceptional merit - and the authors are sharing
this knowledge.

Originator: abrodnik@watdragon.uwaterloo.ca
Organization: Jozef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia
Lines: 69

This is an invitation to send articles to the Informatica magazine.
The first fully international issue has been published and echoes 
are quite favourable. For any information, contact (matjaz.gams@ijs.si). 

Dear Colleague,                                        April 25, 1993

Number 1 of volume 17 of Informatica is now out of print and some of you 
will receive it in a week or so. As you will see, the journal is structured
in the following way: the editorial (first page); profiles (second page
-- biography of an editor, in this issue, Terry Winograd); the edited
part of papers (pp. 3-80); mission and research reports (A plan for
knowledge archives project in Japan and CSLI in Stanford, pp. 81-100);
and news and announcements (pp. 101-108). This structure is mentioned to
give you a suggestion how could you help to make the contents of the
journal significant, diverse, and interesting, bringing your own views
into the discourse.
   A great emphasis is given to the so-called editorial page. This page
expresses an opinion (belief) of the writing editor to some problems
within the scope of computing and informatics, extending into other
concerning disciplines, e.g. cybernetics, advanced AI, cognitive sciences,
mind, informationally concerned neural sciences, advanced technology 
(e.g. photonics), etc. I asked professor Terry Winograd to write this
page for Number 2. I certainly would appreciate very much to get
suggestions or possible offers from other editors, who like to express
their strong (directed) beliefs concerning a future development of the
area in question.
   On the second page of each Number an editor's profile is published.
The aim of the profile is twofold: to show his/her professional 
achievements, interests, scientific, and philosophical orientation on
one side; to narrate his/her life story in the environments in which
editors has lived and live on the other side. This kind of story should
be instructive, adequately factically faced, contributing to the 
understanding of circumstances in which editors have to act and live.
   The edited part (edited papers) is still critical. I would like to have
a stock of accepted papers in advance, so the issuing dates of a particular
number can be fixed (e.g. January, April, July, and October). In situation
right now, I ask you to help me with contributions of yours or your
colleagues, collaborators, students, etc. Some critical views to the
contemporary development of computing and informatics are appreciated.
A special emphasis should be given also to originality by which fresh
ideas are coming into the circulation of different professional communities.
   Reports of different occasions (symposia, conferences, meetings, etc.)
and particularly on new books, papers, and interesting events are welcome.
You can send these news immediately (also by your secretary) by e-mail.
On the other hand, you can send books and other publications (annual
reports, journals, calls for papers, etc.) for reviewing and publishing
in Informatica. We in the editorial staff will manage the rest.
   E-mail is functioning satisfactorily, so please use it in every respect.
You can submit editorial notes, profiles, reports, news and even complete
papers written in standard LaTex format (especially formulas). We received
several final (corrected) texts in Number 1 from different sites (US,
Russia, etc.). In this way, you can compose reports from already typed
texts, using your own choice and editing, and submit them to the contact
person (matjaz.gams@ijs.si), who is always being on your disposal. So,
you will receive a prompt confirmation and any information concerning
our common interest and job.

At the end, please do not forget: we need your cooperation and help in
every mentioned respect. The aim of Informatica is to open various
possibilities of communication concerning strong scientific and 
philosophical orientations as well as those coming up, still unrevealed,
and on the way to become significant. Please, do not apprehend to give
proposals, suggestions, and, certainly, contributions via the e-mail
and by other means.

Sincerely yours,

Anton P. ""Zeleznikar

I was wondering if anyone knows of a graphics package for the PC that
will do compositing of a series of pictures?

What I mean by ""compositing"" is, say I have a live video clip
(digitized) panning around a living room, and a computer-generated
bird flying around the screen.  I want to combine these two series of
pictures so that everywhere where the bird frames are black, I want
the living room picture to show through.  Yes, I realize I can do this
with a genlock, and I do own a genlock, but I want to be able to do
manual compositing also.  It's ok if I have to composite one frame at
a time; I assumed I'd have to do that anyway.  But being able to
composite a series of frames would be even better.

I've looked around and I haven't found a PC package that will perform
this.  Help, please!

I get regular questions about gamma correction since I go to great pains to
deal with it properly in xli (the image loader program I maintain).

Here is an explanation I often use to answer these questions.

This might be suitable for inclusion in the FAQ.

""A note on gamma correction and images""

Author: Graeme W. Gill
        graeme@labtam.oz.au

Date: 93/5/16


""What is all this gamma stuff anyway ?""
--------------------------------------

Although it would be nice to think that ""an image is an image"",
there are a lot of complications. Not only are there a whole bunch of
different image formats (gif, jpeg, tiff etc etc), there is a whole
lot of other technical stuff that makes dealing with images a bit
complicated. Gamma is one of those things. If you've ever downloaded
images from BBS or the net, you've probably noticed (with most image
viewing programs) that some images look ok, some look too dark, and some
look too light. ""Why is this ?"" you may ask. This, is gamma correction
(or the lack of it).

Why do we need gamma correction at all ?
--------------------------------------

Gamma correction is needed because of the nature of CRTs (cathode
ray tubes - the monitors usually used for viewing images). If you
have some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer
image by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of
the scene, then you have created a ""linear"" or un-gamma-corrected
image. This is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulate
the image as if the values in the image file were light (ie. adding
and multiplying will work just like real light in the real world).
Now if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage
and feed it into a CRT, you find that the CRT _doesn't_ give you
an amount of light proportional to the voltage. The amount of light
coming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage
something like this:

Light_out = voltage ^ crt_gamma

So if you just dump your nice linear image out to a CRT, the image
will look much too dark. To fix this up you have to ""gamma correct""
the image first. You need to do the opposite of what the CRT
will do to the image, so that things cancel out, and you get
what you want. So you have to do this to your image:

gamma_corrected_image = image ^ (1/crt_gamma)

For most CRTs, the crt_gamma is somewhere between 1.0 and 3.0.

If that is all it is, why does it seem so complicated ?
-----------------------------------------------------

The problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction.
Also not all sources of images give you linear images (Video cameras
or video signals in general). Because of this, a lot of images
already have some gamma correction done to them, and you are 
rarely sure how much. If you try and display one of those images
with a program that does gamma correction for you, the image gets
corrected twice and looks way to light. If you display one of those
images with a program that doesn't do gamma correction, then it will
look vaguely right, but not perfect, because the gamma correction is
not exactly right for you particular CRT.

Whose fault is all this ?
-----------------------

It is really three things. One is all those display programs
out there that don't do gamma correction properly. Another is
that most image formats don't specify a standard gamma, or
don't have some way or recording what their gamma correction is.
The third thing is that not many people understand what gamma
correction is all about, and create a lot of images with varying
gamma's.

At least two file formats do the right thing.
The Utah Graphics Toolkit .rle format has a semi-standard way of recording
the gamma of an image. The JFIF file standard (that uses JPEG compression)
specifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of 1.0 (ie. a
linear image - but not everyone obeys the rules).

Some image loaders (for instance xli - an X11 image utility)
allow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you
are using, but the individual gamma values of image you are trying to
view. Other image viewers (eg. xv another X11 image program) and
utilities (eg. the pbm toolkit) provide ways of changing the gamma
of an image, but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction
yourself, allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has,
and then the gamma correction you need to suite your CRT monitor.

[ Note that xv 2.21 doesn't provide an easy way of modifying the
gamma of an image. You need to adjust the R, G and B curves to the
appropriate gamma in the ColEdit controls. Altering the Intensity
in the HSV controls doesn't do the right thing, as it fails to
take account of the effect gamma has on H and S. This tends
to give a tint to the image. ]

How can I figure out what my viewer does, or what gamma my screen has ?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgamma.jpg
(provided with xli distribution), which is a JFIF jpeg format file
containing two grayscale ramps. The ramps are chosen to look linear
to the human eye, one using continuous tones, and the other using
dithering.  If your viewer does the right thing and gamma corrects
images, then the two ramps should look symmetrical, and the point
at which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half
way from the top to the bottom. (To find this point it helps if
you move away a little from the screen, and de-focus your eyes a
bit.)

If your viewer doesn't do gamma correction, then left hand ramp will have
a long dark part and a short white part, and the point of equal brightness
will be above the center.

If your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correction
for a display, then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the
gamma, and decrease it if it is below the center. The value will usually be
around 2.2 

[with xli for instance, you can adjust the display gamma with the
-dispgamma flag, and once you've got it right, you can set the DISPLAY_GAMMA
environment variable in your .profile]

How do I figure out what the gamma of an image is ?
-------------------------------------------------

This is the most tricky bit. As a general rule it seems that a lot of
true color (ie. 24 bit, .ppm .jpg) images have a gamma of
1.0 (linear), although there are many about that have some gamma
correction. It seems that the majority of pseudo color images
(ie. 8 bit images with color maps - .gif etc.) are gamma corrected
to some degree or other.

If your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will
look good, and gamma corrected images will look too light.

If your viewer doesn't do gamma correction, then linear images will
look too dark, and gamma corrected images will ok.

Why Linear images are sometimes not such a good thing
-----------------------------------------------------

One of the reason that many high quality formats (such as
Video) use gamma correction is that it actually makes better
use of the storage medium. This is because the human
eye has a logarithmic response to light, and gamma correction
has a similar compression characteristic. This means images 
could make better use of 8 bits per color (for instance),
if they used gamma correction. The implication though, is that
every time you want to do any image processing you should
convert the 8 bit image to 12 or so linear bits to retain
the same accuracy. Since little popular software does this, and
none of the popular image formats can agree on a standard
gamma correction factor, it is difficult to justify gamma corrected
images at the popular level.

If some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma,
and if image manipulation software takes care to use
extra precision when dealing with linearized internal data,
then gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing.

(I am told that the Kodak PhotoCD format for instance, has a
standard gamma correction factor that enables it to get the
highest quality out of the bits used to hold the image).

   2. Once image file is successfully read, you will enter 'screen' menu.
      You can do special effect on image.
      pressing RETURN: show image.
        in graphic mode, press RETURN, SPACE or ESCAPE to return to text
        mode.
      pressing TAB: change processing target. This program allows you to do
        special effects on 8-bit or 24-bit image.

        Full Color: save as color image(8 bits).
        True Color: save as 24-bit image.

        This program will ask you some questions if you want to write image
        to file. Some questions are format-dependent. Finally This program
        will prompt you a filename. If you want to save file under another
        directory other than current directory, please press SPACE. after
        pressing SPACE, you will enter 'write2' menu. You can change
        directory to what you want. Then,

        pressing SPACE: this program will prompt you 'original' filename.
        pressing RETURN: this program will prompt you 'selected' filename
                      (filename under bar).


  3. This program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.

  4. This Program is MEMORY GREEDY. If you don't have enough memory,
     the performance is poor.

  5. If you want to save 8 bits image :
       try GIF then TIFF(LZW) then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then ...

     If you want to save 24 bits image (lossless):
       try TIFF(LZW) or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster
       (No one is better for true 24bits image)

  6. I recommend Jpeg for storing 24 bits images, even 8 bits images.

  7. Not all subroutines are fully tested

  8. This document is not well written. If you have any PROBLEM, SUGGESTION,
     COMMENT about this program,

The alt.* hierarchie is created for 2 purposes:
1. For groups which do not fit under the comp.* or other 'official'
  hierarchies
2. For the fast creation of hot new newsgroups like alt.gulf.war

Because there is no voting process or any other control facilities,
sites are free to decide not to carry (some of) the alt groups.

Therefore, it is (I think) desirable to try to create comp.graphics.
{raytrace, rendering or whatever} and not an alt-group

There might be an IPAS routine that does that,but I can'r be sure.  Another
way to do it is to render the scene without the glass object and save the
image.  Then assign that image to your glass object as a reflection.  It will
take a lot of adjusting for position and size of the reflection, but that's

I'm also interested in info both public domain and commercial graphics library 
package to do PC VGA graphics.  

I'm currently working on a realtime application running on a PCC with a 
non-DOS kernel that needs to do some simple graphics.  I'm not sure if 
reentrancy of the graphics library is going to be an issue or not.  
I suspect I'll implement the display controller as a server process that 
handles graphics requests, queued on a mailbox, one at a time.  If this 
provides sufficiently frequent display updates then I believe that I can 
restrict all graphics operations to be performed by the server and thus 
constrain access to the library to a this single process and avoid the need
for a reentrant graphics library.  

Being fairly new to the realtime systems world I may be overlooking something,
what do you think?

Hello,

We are looking for a graphics package (preferably complete
with source code) that will run on our UNIX operating system
(a Sequent running DYNIX 3.2).  This graphics package must 
support a wide variety of character based graphics devices 
(PC's running a terminal emulator, primarily).  
At this point, X11 graphics is not an option.

This graphics program should, if possible, support these
sorts of graphics operations (minimum requirements):

   1) Complicated axes (log, linear, etc.) with fairly
      precise axis labels (multi-line labels, etc.)
      Major and minor tickmarks on axes, etc.	
  
   2) It would be nice if some limited amount of color
      plotting were available, if the output device
      supported it.

We have a copy of gnuplot and are currently using it, but
gnuplot has some limitations.  We are looking for something
more robust than gnuplot.

At this point, I'm looking for information about packages that
might solve our problems.  If you have any information, please
contact me at the above email address.  If the product you know
about is a commercial software package, please send a phone number
or email address so that I can contact them about pricing, etc.

There are some tricks to installing ATM to windows... install them first
to dos, then run the ATM control panel to get them into windows.

The best reason for ATM is that Adobe IS the standard.  Truetype is a
failed MS venture to undercut Adobe when Adobe was being nasty about
keeping their formats proprietary.  Just about any service bureau or print
shop will smirk and send you on your way if you bring a TrueType document
to them for high resolution printing or ripping.

Although there are lots of pretty TT fonts floating around, they are really
for dot matrix or your own lazer printer.
However, you can convert your TT fonts with Fontmonger or some similar program
to ATM fonts for high end stuff.

If you are using dot matrix for all your printing, you may have wasted
your money!

Hello,
I have some problem in converting tga file(generated by POVray) to

Error messages are,
% targatorle -o o.rle data.tga

I know that I need to install ppmtorle and tgatoppm, but I do not spend
time to install them. Even I do not want to generate .rgb from POVray
and then convert them to rle, if possible.(.rgb to rle works, but
it will mess up my directory with so many files, and it needs 2 more
steps to finally convert to rle file. say cat | rawtorle | rleflip )
Does any body out there have same experience/problems ?

Subject: Please Help: Point in concave Polyhedra
Lines: 43

Dear Netters:


I am looking for C source code to test if a 3D point lies within a

concave polyhadra. I have read a few articles about this and know

that two solutions exist: parity counting and angle sumation. Both


ideas are pretty simple but coding is not. So I wonder if there exists

public domain source code for this.

    Another 'rough' solition (don't care special cases) is ray-casting

which is reported to be more or less independent of number of faces

consisting the polyhedra if a special space indexing is used
(M. Tamminen, et. al., 1984. ""Ray-casting and block model conversion
using a spatial index"". Computer-Aided-Designs. 4, 1984, 60-65).
But the prerequirement is that all the facets of polyhedra have their
normal pointing outside of polyhedra. How this could be done in practice ?
I have a set of trangles consisting the polyhedra. How could I ensure their
normals pointing outside the polyhedra ? The paper mentioned above assumed
this is already the case.


   I have also read some standard computer graphics textbook about hidden
line removal. It says ""if we make the rule that the normal of a facet pointing

toward viewer standing far away from the polyhedra..."". Again how to make
sure ?


   Any pointers are welcome ?

Hello, I've raytraced and rendered and the only difference I've found 
is that raytracing takes a hell of a lot longer. Am I missing
something?

    First of all (this is NOT a snide response), if you're confused about
this issue, you will stumble over a lot of other things as well.  I suggest
that the weakness is your reference material.  Get ""An Introduction to Ray
Tracing"" by Andrew Glassner for very good coverage of the raytracing
algorithm.  You could also refer to the 2nd edition of Foley & Van Dam.

    On to the question.  The simple answer is that you just keep adding up
all the contributions and then clamping at the maximum intensity.  For
example, if your intensity values range from 0.0 to 1.0, then keep adding up
and clamp the resultant values to 1.0 (you might have to clamp the lower
bound to 0.0 if you have dark bulbs, but that's another issue =^).  So, you
get some illumination equation like this:

        I = Lambient + Ldiffuse(light[n]) + Lreflected + Ltransparent

    The contribution due to reflection is just summed with the light
intensity, as is the light due to transparency.  Now, a slightly less
hand-waving illumination equation is this:

        I = KaLa + KdLd(light[n]) + KrLr + KtLt

    That is, each component of the illumination equation is governed by the
material constants Ka, Kd, Kr and Kt.  So the maximum you can get from
transparency for a given object, for example, might be [0.4, 0.1, 0.5] for a
purple-colored glass object.

    Hopefully this answers your question.  I'll forward my ""illumination
equation sermon"" to you also.

    Yes.  There are many methods of rendering, raytracing is one of them.
You didn't say what you mean by rendering, so I won't guess.  Methods of
rendering include:

        o  Pencil and graph paper, doing the math by hand

        o  Wireframe rendering of the 2D projection

        o  Hidden line rendering

        o  Scanline rendering using:
            - Painter's algorithm.
            - BSP trees.
            - Z buffer
            - Other

        o  Raytracing

        o  Radiosity

        o  Holographic projection to film

        o  Combination of any of the above

This is almost certainly a MacBinary file which is an encoded version
of a mac file so the Resource fork and Data fork get preserved.
You need a program that converts this to a regular file. If this is a
macbinary file, you may have downloaded it in Text mode and is probably
corrupt (if you did). If you're using FTP to transfer it at any point make sure
you type ""binary"" first.

If you can open the file with a text editor and find
(This file must be converted with Bin....
at the top, it is a BinHex file and can be decoded with
BinHex 4.0 (among other programs).

           Cornell Theory Center Summer School
 
          Offered through the Cornell School of
        Continuing Education and Summer Sessions
 
                  Course Description
 
 Within the past ten years, the  simulation and  modeling of
Lines: 197

molecules has evolved from an esoteric academic subject into
a  international  industry. Computer  graphics has played  a
decisive role in this transformation by allowing chemists to
build, visualize and interact with complex geometrical objects.
 
While computer scientists are conversant in the language of their
own discipline, they are often unfamiliar with the terminology,
simulation techniques and practical needs of research chemists.
Similarly, chemists are often unfamiliar with the latest paradigms
and technological advances in graphical computing.
 
This interdisciplinary course is intended to bridge the gap
between computer science and chemistry and to equip chemistry
researchers who wish to be more than just casual users of
prepackaged graphics software. Although this is not intended to
be a course in computational chemistry or drug design, data sets
from chemical research problems will be used in lab and students
will be encouraged to bring data sets of their own. Lab exercises
and projects will be carried out using data-flow programming
(IBM Visualization Data Explorer software) and students will have
access to Cornell Theory Center computing resources, including video
recording equipment.
 
Audience:  researchers and students in the chemical and biological
           sciences interested in integrating state-of-the-art
           computer graphics into their research; computer scientists
           wishing to gain familiarity with a major application of
           scientific visualization.
 
           The class size will be limited to 25 participants on a
           first-come first-served basis.
 
Level:     Graduate/advanced undergraduate, 1 or 2 Credits. May be taken
           without credit as a workshop. Calculus, linear algebra
           and introductory chemistry required. Familiarity with Unix,
           X-windows and C is useful but not required.
 
Date:   June 14-25, 1993  (2 Credits)
        June 14-18, 1993  (1 or 0 credits)
 
Time:   Mon-Fri 9:00 am to 12:00 pm and 1:00 pm to 4:00 pm
 
Cost:   0 or 1 credit       $410
        2 credits           $820
 
Format
 
The course will be held in the Theory Center training facility
where computer workstations will be available.  Daily lectures will be
interspersed with laboratory exercises and ample time will be provided
for project enablement and familiarization with the new computing
environment. Students enrolled for one credit will be graded on the basis
of their laboratory exercises and short final project. Those enrolled
for a second credit will receive more advanced lectures, be given
more time for project development and meet daily to share experience
and discuss problems encountered.
 
Content (may vary)
 
    Elements of computer graphics
         polygonal rendering, lighting models, ray tracing, volumetric
         rendering, stereo graphics, animation, introduction to data-flow
         programming (DX), interactivity.
 
    Representing the atom
         size, time and energy scales
         basic classical and quantum mechanics
 
    Important categories of molecules
         small molecules, biopolymers, surfaces and catalysts,
         miscellaneous current applications
 
    Data formats and conversions
 
    Advanced molecular graphics techniques
 
    Types of simulation and experiment
         electronic structure, molecular dynamics/mechanics
         electrostatics, X-ray crystallography, NMR, quantum
         dynamics and spectroscopy.
 
Instructors
 
The course will be taught by two instructors. Topics related to computer
graphics will be handled by Dr. Bruce Land, Project Leader of Visualization,
Cornell National Supercomputing Facility. Chemistry-specific aspects
of the course will be handled by Dr. Richard E. Gillilan, Visualization
Specialist and Research Scientist, Cornell National Supercomputing Facility

1. ARCHIE
=========

The Archie is a service system to locate FTP places for
requested files. It's appreciated that you will use Archie
before asking help in the newsgroups.

Archie servers:
  archie.au or 139.130.4.6             (Aussie/NZ)
  archie.funet.fi or 128.214.6.100  (Finland/Eur.)
  archie.th-darmstadt.de or 130.83.128.111  (GER.)
  cs.huji.ac.il or 132.65.6.5             (Israel)
  archie.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp or 130.54.20.1 (JAPAN)
  archie.sogang.ac.kr or 163.239.1.11      (Korea)
  archie.ncu.edu.tw or telnet 140.115.19.24  (TWN)
  archie.doc.ic.ac.uk or 146.169.3.7  (UK/Ireland)
  archie.sura.net or 128.167.254.179    (USA [MD])
  archie.unl.edu (password: archie1)    (USA [NE])
  archie.ans.net or 147.225.1.2         (USA [NY])
  archie.rutgers.edu or 128.6.18.15     (USA [NJ])
  archie.nz or 130.195.9.4           (New Zealand)

Connect to Archie server with telnet and type ""archie"" as username.
To get help type 'help'.
You can get 'xarchie' or 'archie', which are clients that call Archie
without the burden of a telnet session.
'Xarchie' is on the X11.R5 contrib tape, and 'archie' on comp.sources.misc,
vol. 27.

To get information on how to use Archie via e-mail, send mail with
subject ""help"" to ""archie"" account at any of above sites.

(Note to Janet/PSS users -- the United Kingdom archie site is
accessible on the Janet host doc.ic.ac.uk [000005102000].
Connect to it and specify ""archie"" as the host name and ""archie"" as
the username.)

==========================================================================

2. Notes
========
(Excerpted from the FAQ article)

Please do *not* post or mail messages saying ""I can't FTP, could
someone mail this to me?""  There are a number of automated mail servers
that will send you things like this in response to a message.

There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups
and make them available via an email query system.  You send a message
to an automated server saying something like ""send comp.sources.unix/fbm"",
and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.

Ray-tracers:
------------

RayShade - a great ray tracer for workstations on up, also for PC, Mac & Amiga.
PoV - son and successor to DKB trace, written by Compuservers.
	(For more questions call Drew Wells --
	73767.1244@compuserve.com or Dave Buck -- david_buck@carleton.ca)
ART - ray tracer with a good range of surface types, part of VORT package.
DKBtrace - another good ray tracer, from all reports; PCs, Mac II,
	Amiga, UNIX, VMS (last two with X11 previewer), etc.
RTrace - Portugese ray tracer, does bicubic patches, CSG, 3D text, etc. etc.
	An MS-DOS version for use with DJGPP DOS extender (GO32) exists also,
	as a Mac port.
VIVID2 - A shareware raytracer for PCs - binary only (286/287).  Author:

	is available to registered users (US$50) direct from the author.
RAY4 - Steve Hollasch's 4-dimensional ray tracer - renders hyperspheres,
	hypertetrahedra, hyperplanes, and hyperparallelepipeds (there's
	a separate real-time wireframe viewer written in GL called WIRE4 ) .
MTV,QRT,DBW - yet more ray tracers, some with interesting features.

Distributed/Parallel Raytracers:

        the BibTeX files via FTP and peruse them offline, or telnet to
        ""siggraph.org"" and log in as ""biblio"" and interactively search
        the database for entries of interest, by keyword.
        For the people without Internet access, there's also an e-mail
        server. Send mail to

        archive-server@siggraph.org

        and in the subject or the body of the message include the message  send
        followed by the topic and subtopic you wish. A good place to start is

4. Mail servers and graphics-oriented BBSes
===========================================

Please check first with the FTP places above, with archie's help.
Don't overuse mail servers.

There are some troubles with wrong return addresses. Many of these
mail servers have a command like
   path a_valid_return_e-mail_address
to get a hint for sending back to you stuff.

DEC's FTPMAIL
-------------
  Send a one-line message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com WITHOUT a Subject: field,
  and having a line containing the word 'help'.
  You should get back a message detailing the relevant procedures you
  must follow in order to get the files you want.

  Note that the ""reply"" or ""answer"" command in your mailer will not work
  for this message or any other mail you receive from FTPMAIL.  To send
  requests to FTPMAIL, send an original mail message, not a reply.
  Complaints should be sent to the ftpmail-request@uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com
  address rather than to postmaster, since DECWRL's postmaster is not
  responsible for fixing ftpmail problems.

BITFTP
------
  For BITNET sites ONLY, there's BITFTP@PUCC.
  Send a one-line 'help' message to this address for more info.


+RED
+---
+  RED - Listserv Redirector is essentially a mail server.
+  The Server Sites that are available are:

Lightwave 3D mail based file-server
-----------------------------------
  A mail based file server for 3D objects, 24bit JPEG images, GIF images
  and image maps is now online for all those with Internet mail access.
  The server is the official archive site for the Lightwave 3D mail-list
  and contains many PD and Shareware graphics utilities for
  several computer platforms including Amiga, Atari, IBM and Macintosh.

  The server resides on a BBS called ""The Graphics BBS"".  The BBS is
  operational 24 hours a day 7 days a week at the phone number of +1
  908/469-0049.  It has upgraded its modem to a Hayes Ultra 144
  V.32bis/V.42bis, which has speeds from 300bps up to 38,400bps.

  If you would like to submit objects, scenes or images to the server,
  please pack, uuencode and then mail the files to the address:
  server@bobsbox.rent.com.

  For information on obtaining files from the server send a mail message
  to the address file-server@graphics.rent.com with the following in
  the body of the message:
    HELP
    /DIR
  And a help file describing how to use the server and a complete
  directory listing will be sent to you via mail.

[ Now it includes the Cyberware head and shouders in TTDDD format! Check it
 out, only if you can't use FTP! -- nfotis ]

INRIA-GRAPHLIB
--------------
  Pierre Jancene and Sabine Coquillart launched the inria-graphlib mail
  server a few months ago.

    echo help | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr

  will give you a quick summary of what inria-graphlib contains and 
  how to browse among its files.

    echo send contents | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr

  will return the extended summary.

  As an other example :

    echo send cgrl from Misc | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr

  will return the Computer Graphics Resource Listing mirrored from
  comp.graphics.

7. Scene description languages
==============================

NFF
---
  Neutral file format , by Eric Haines. Very simple, there are some
  procedural database generators in the SPD package, and many objects
  floating in various FTP sites. There's also a previewer written in
  HP Starbase from E.Haines. Also there's one written in VOGLE, so you can
  use any of the devices VOGLE can output on.
  (Check in sites carrying VOGLE, like gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au)

OFF
---
  Object file format, from DEC's Randy Rost (rost@kpc.com).
[ The object archive server seems to be mothballed. In a future version,
 I'll remove the ref. to it -- nfotis ]

  Available also through their mail server. To obtain help about using this
  service, send a message with a ""Subject:"" line containing only the word
  ""help"" and a null message body to: object-archive-server@decwrl.dec.com.
  [For FTP places to get it, see in the relevant place]. There's an OFF
  previewer for SGI 4D machines, called off-preview in
  godzilla.cgl.rmit.oz.au . There are previewers for xview and sunview,
  also on gondwana.

TDDD
----
It's a library of 3D objects with translators to/from OFF, NFF,
Rayshade, Imagine or vort objects.
Edited copy of the announcement follows (from Raytracing News, V4,#3):

  New Library of 3D Objects Available via FTP, by Steve Worley
  (worley@cup.portal.com)

  I have assembled a set of over 150 3D objects in a binary format
  called TDDD. These objects range from human figures to airplanes,
  from semi-trucks to lampposts.  These objects are all freely
  distributable, and most have READMEs that describe them.

  In order to convert these objects to a human-readable format, a file
  with the specification of TDDD is included in the directory with the
  objects. There is also a shareware system called TTDDDLIB (officially
  on hubcap.clemson.edu) that will convert (ala PBM+) to/from various
  object formats : Imagine TTDDD (extension of TDDD?), OFF, NFF,
  Rayshade 4.0, or vort. Source included for Amiga/Unix as executables
  for the Amiga. Also outputs Framemaker MIF files and isometric views
  in Postscript.

P3D
---
  From Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. The P3D uses lisp with slight
  extensions to store three-dimensional models. A simple lisp
  interpreter is included with the P3D release, so there is no need to
  have access to any vendor's lisp to run this software.

  The mouse-driven user interfaces for Motif, Open Look, and Silicon
  Graphics GL, and the DrawP3D subroutine library for generating P3D
  without ever looking at the underlying Lisp.

  The P3D software currently supports nine renderers.  They are:
  Painter - Painter's Algorithm, Dore, Silicon Graphics Inc. GL language,
  Generic Phigs, Sun Phigs+, DEC Phigs+, Rayshade, ART ray tracer (from
  VORT package) and Pixar RenderMan.

  The code is available via anonymous FTP from the machines
  ftp.psc.edu, directory pub/p3d, and nic.funet.fi, directory
  pub/graphics/programs/p3d.

RenderMan
---------
  Pixar's RenderMan is not free - call Pixar for details.

==========================================================================

8. Solids description formats
=============================

a. EEC's ESPRIT project 322 CAD*I (CAD Interfaces) has developed a
  neutral file format for transfer of CAD data (curves, surfaces, and
  solid models between CAD systems and from CAD to CAA (Computer Aided
  Analysis) an CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing)

b. IGES [v. 5.1 now] tries to define a standard to tranfer solid
  models - Brep and CSG. The current standard number is ANSI Y14.26M-1987
  For documentation, you might want to contact Nancy Flower at
  NCGA Technical Services and Standards, 1-800-225-6242 ext. 325
  and the cost is $100.
  This standard is not available in electronic format.

c. PDES/STEP : This slowly emerging standard tries to encompass not only
  the geometrical information, but also for things like FEM, etc.
  The main bodies besides this standard are NIST and DARPA. You can get
  more information about PDES by sending mail to nptserver@cme.nist.gov
  and putting the line
	send index
  in the body (NOT the Subject:) area of the message.

  The people at Rutherford Appleton Lab.  are also working
  on STEP tools: they have an EXPRESS compiler and an Exchange file parser,
  both available in source form (and for free) for research purposes.
  Soon they will also have an EXPRESS-based database system.

  For the tools contact Mike Mead, Phone: +44 (0235) 44 6710 (FAX: x 5893),

Rome was under attack by barbarians, they sent for advice to some Oracle,

Cybele was the quintessential wiccan goddess, there was Her and her son &
lover, Attis. Yucky idea if you ask me. OK the book says she was Phrygian,
from the neolithic matriarchal society Catal Huyuk (Turkey). Worshipped 1st
as Black Stone (that Kaaba in Mecca ring a bell maybe????) Carried to Rome
in 205BC to save them from Hannibal.


Response:

Is there some relation between the name 'Cybele' and the phenemenon of the
'sibyl'?  Your paragraph above seems to indicate there might be.

My understanding is that Islam was founded on the remains of a goddess
cult or two.  Many Muslims would not like to hear that. ;>


You:

It gets more interesting. Romans called her Great Mother (Magna Mater),
could be the reason why so many of those Mary statues in Europe are black,
prob. IS connected to that Ka'aba they've got in Mecca, 3rd cent. AD She was
supreme Goddess in Lyons, France . . . Attis was castrated and formed into
a pine tree . . . she should be worshiped on 25 Mar . . . in Rome it was
an ecstatic cult, her priests wore drag, worked themselves up in dance and
castrated themselves in order to initiate to her, lived their lives as women.
They wore make up and jewelry and the whole bit.

Only other such primitive transsexualism I know of goes on in India (where
else?) where they do that castration thing under some meditation maybe, I
forget by now...there's a book on that.)

Of course, that excepts that weird Russian / Romanian 18th cent. Xian cult
that did all kinds of self-castration too, I forget their name.


Response:

I'd love to get details or references on any of the above.  My own exploration
of this issue has only extended to a brief examination of the Zuni 'berdache'.
_The Zuni Man-Woman_, by Will Roscoe, University of New Mexico Press, 1991
probably has some interesting things to say about them.  I've yet to
procure it.

Any details or references on:

Ecstatic cults in Rome, India, Russia/Romania (Christian too?) which
exhibit any type of transsexualism or transvestitism, male OR female
(though I expect mostly the former will be found ;>).


Thanks for your interesting posts, Charles. :>

Brian, does all this mean that you have to be well versed in ancient
Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic in order to understand the core of
Christianity? I hope you are not Catholic, because my Christian
upbringing was based on the teachings of Luther, and the one of
the core messages was basically that you don't need to know latin
in order to learn about salvation.

BTW, your statement would also eliminate about 99.5% of all the Christians
in the world, as well.

Thank you, Steve.  It is refreshing to have someone accuse me of being
a Christian.  I only hope enough evidence can be garnered to get a
conviction.  I am not certain what you mean by the ""fundy"" part as the
term fundamentalist has a wide variety of uses.  If you refer to
those who actually believe Jesus is the Messiah and Son of God and
wish to follow in his way, then I plead guilty.  But what does it
matter what I think.  The Roman circus is over.  The lions have been
satisfied -- for now.  The Emperor, after the long and gruelling
struggle, sensed the crowd was tiring and gave thumbs down.

With respect to my previous comments about David Koresh, I urge you
to re-examine my previous posts.  I believe you mistakenly assume
that defense of Koresh' right to his own personal beliefs and his
right to express them to others implies agreement with Koresh'
theology.  Actually I understand little about the details of Branch-
Davidian teachings and regret so many are hung-up on that aspect
of the tragic events of the past few days.

Nor do I think Koresh' sex life should be of any interest to the
federal government.  Of course Hillary says he had been molesting
infants so it must be true even though such allegations do not
fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government; they are
state and local matters and have been thoroughly reviewed at the
local level by proper authorities with no successful charge having
ever been levied against him.  Under American law, he was innocent
as Americans are presumed innocent until proven guilty.  At least
that's how it is suppposed to be.  But he was demonized and propa-
gandized against by a powerful machine to have him appear as a
lustful beast and therefore deserving of every ill the fates might
bring upon him.  

But evidence trickles in that the twenty-one children, who left the
building in the early days of the siege,  were carefully examined
by qualified authorities for evidence of physical or sexual abuse
and none was found.  DeGuerin, one of the attorneys who met with
Davidians several times before the conflagration, reported that
the children seemed well adjusted and showed no sign of abuse.

Ultimately, Steve, what I think about the heart of David Koresh
is quite unimportant.  Today he is in the benevolent hands of a
most wise and merciful judge who will one day surely judge us all.
So I withhold any judgment of David Koresh and defer to the One
who has all knowledge.  Meanwhile, let's clean up the mess left
on earth and keep this from happening again by sending a strong
message to the government to respect the inalienable rights of the
people it serves.

        It should be remembered that all of the first reports came from 
       the FBI, and that independent observers, i.e. the press, were not 
       allowed to get close and see things for themselves.  Official 
       communiques tend to be self-serving for the agencies that issue 
       them. 
        People in general tend to believe first reports, as these get 
       the most and the biggest headlines.  Corrections are often 
       overlooked. 
         An example is the FBI report that several of the bodies found 
       in the rubble had bullet wounds.  The local coroner, who is 
       independent of the FBI, has so far found no bullet wounds!

Recently, I've asked myself a rather interesting question: What RIGHT does
god have on our lives (always assuming there is a god, of course...!) ??

In his infinite wisdom, he made it perfectly clear that if we don't live
according to his rules, we will burn in hell. Well, with what RIGHT can god
make that desicion? Let's say, for the sake of argument, that god creates every
one of us (directly or indirectly, it doesn't matter.). What then happens, is
that he first creates us, and then turns us lose. Well, I didn't ask to be
created. 

Let's make an analogue. If a scientist creates a unique living creature (which
has happened, it was even patented...!!!), does he then have the right to
expect it to behave in a certain matter, or die...?

Who is god to impose its rules on us ? Who can tell if god is REALLY so
righteous as god likes us to believe? Are all christians a flock of sheep,
unable to do otherwise that follow the rest? 

Hmmmmmmmmmmmm.

I just want to point out that this is not sarcasm, I mean it.

I think I see where you are coming from Kent.  Jesus doesn't view
guilt like our modern venacular colors it.   

""Feelings"" have nothing to do with guilt.  Feelings arise from the state of 
being guilty.  Feeling and guilt are mutally exclusive.  Feelings are a 
reaction from guilt.  Jesus is talking about the guilt state, not the 
reaction.   Let me give you an example:

Have you ever made a mistake?  Have you ever lied to someone?  Even a
little white lie?   Have you ever claimed to know something that you really 
didn't know?  Have you ever hated someone?  Have you ever been selfish?
Are you guilty of any one of these?   The answer is of course, YES.  You
are guilty.  Period.  That is it what Jesus is getting at.  No big surprise.  
Feelings do not even enter the picture.   Consider Jesus's use of the word
""guilt"" as how a court uses it.

Jesus is concerned that everyone should admit that they are guilty of being
imperfect.  The Bible calls it the state that we are all sinners.  We all do
bad things.  Even the most insignficant thing that we do wrong is proof of our 
guilt that we are all sinners.     It is it in our nature to do bad things. 
We are sinners, therefore we do bad things.  Being a sinner is fact.  It is
not a pleasant fact.  But it is just a fact.  We are not perfect.   Calling us
sinners should have no more emotional charge to you than calling you a
human being.  Guilty as charged.

> and then there's this single personality that will save you from this
> universal guilt feeling.

You can handle your guilt in one of two ways:  Acknowledge you
made a mistake, learn from it, and try to not do it again--in
the meantime, not punishing yourself for it:  which is the
way Jesus wants you to handle or it.  This is the healthy way.

Or two, the destructive way:  put yourself down, slap yourself
and feel like crap, never forgive yourself, force yourself to
say a thousand Hail Marys . . . even to suicide.  This the way 
Jesus does NOT want us to deal with it.   All people fall into this 
category to some extent in their lives.

Jesus is not in the business of saving us from this guilt
feeling.  Jesus is in the business of showing us how much he
loves us despite our guilt.  Jesus knows we are guilty.  That
isn't new to him.  It is no big deal to him. He just wants you to realize 
that this sinful nature destroys the relationship between you and him.
That is what he wants you to know.  Why, because he wants to 
have your company.  You are immensely valuable to him.
Jesus wants a relationship with you, however, in our present
sinful nature, we are incapable of having this relationship.  

God is perfect.  We are not.  You cannot fit a square peg into
a round hole.  However, God has provided a way for us to
change our nature so that we can have a relationship with him.
God has provided Jesus, so that whosoever just believes in
Jesus, will have their nature changed.  The Holy Spirit will
move it.  And now divine nature is now within lives our very
being--and us and God communicate with each through his
unifying Holy Spirit.  The benefits of this are endless.  For
with the divine nature living within us, we can now see
our imperfections better.  We can now head them off at the pass.  With
the power of the Holy Spirit living in us, we now have his power
to help us overcome our shortcomings.   Because the divine nature lives 
within us, we can now understand profound Bible passages that never before
we could understand.  Because the divine nature now lives within us, we now 
have authority over demonic forces.  And lastly, because the divine 
nature now lives within us, we have eternal life--for the Holy Spirit
is eternal.

The relationship with Jesus is of the utmost importance.  Because
it is not what you do in life that qualifies you to belong to
heavenly kingdom, it is your relationship to the living God.
Remember what Jesus said at the tail end of Matthew when he
separated the ""goats from the sheep"".   Many people in the
last day will ask him, ""Didn't I prophesy in your name and do
miracles, and do good things in your name?""   And what did Jesus say?
""Depart from me, for I never *knew* you.""  That is the cornerstone of 
Christianity, Kent.  Jesus must know you as his friend.  It is your 
relationship to Jesus.  If he is your friend and you are his, you will
be counted among those who will share in his inheritance in heaven.

> I do mistakes, and I regret them, however I've never had this
> huge guilt feeling hanging over my shoulder.

Good.  It shows that you have a strong self-image--that you
love yourself.  That is the second greatest commandment Jesus
taught.  If only more people could do as you do.   As I said before, 
in the common english venacular, ""feeling guilty"" has a
different meaning than the state of guilt.

I believe what we all need in our personalities is a lot less ego,
a lot less self-centeredness, and a lot more unconditional love.

Yes.  You have stated what Jesus said.  Remember?  ""Come to me,
take my yoke upon your shoulders, for my burden is light.""  A yoke
is used to direct oxen to do work.  Once you have a relationship with 
Jesus, you and him share the yoke and the burdens of life.  Having 
God at your side is of great advantage.

This is always an option: when the sect is causing harm, re-label

...in other words faith in a .357 is far stronger than faith in a 
God providing a miracle for his followers. Interesting. Now, if 
David Korresh was God, why couldn't he use lightning instead of 
semi-automatic rifles? It seems even he didn't trust in himself.

If you say X statement and give it the authority of fact, I will respond
by asking you why. You aren't obligated to say anything, but if your

of proof is upon you.

To surmise, the burden of proof is upon you if you wish us to believe that

Someone stated that the Davidian cult should not be associated
with Christianity. Well, I read all those four postings, and I'm
now even more convinced that Davididians are truly Christian
in nature. But sometimes it makes sense to re-label the cult, 
especially if the ugliness is too much to handle.

Rick, I think we can safely say, 1) Robert is not the only person
who understands the Bible, and 2), the leadership of the LDS church
historicly never has.  Let's consider some ""personal interpretations""
and see how much trust we should put in ""Orthodox Mormonism"", which
could never be confused with Orthodox Christianity.

        In one of his attacks on Christians, the Mormon Apostle Bruce R.
McConkie said they ""thrash around in...darkness in trying to identify
Elohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the promised
Messiah."" He also said Christians are wrong to believe ""that Jehovah is
the Supreme Deity [God the Father],"" and that Christ ""came into
mortality"" as His ""Only Begotten"" Son. McConkie then stated what Mormons
believe today to be the truth about the matter. He said that ""Elohim is
the Father"" and ""Jehovah is the Son.""

  ""Being thus aware of how far astray the religious intellectualists
  have gone in defining their three-in-one God, it comes as no surprise
  to learn that they thrash around in the same darkness in trying to
  identify Elohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the
  promised Messiah. Some sectarians even believe that Jehovah is the
  Supreme Deity whose Son came into mortality as the Only Begotten. As
  with their concept that God is a Spirit, this misinformation about the
  Gods of Heaven is untrue. The fact is, and it too is attested by Holy
  Writ, that Elohim is the Father, and that Jehovah is the Son who was
  born into mortality as the Lord Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah.
  (Promised Messiah, p. 100)

        Notice that McConkie said the Christians are as wrong about
their ""three-in-one God"" and their belief that ""God is a Spirit"" as they
are in their understanding of who ""Elohim"" and ""Jehovah"" are. Before
examining McConkie's attack and its validity, we shall read a few more
statements by McConkie and other Mormon sources concerning the words
""Elohim"" and ""Jehovah."" McConkie stated:

  ""...the chief designation of Christ that has been preserved for us in
  the Old Testament, as that ancient work is now published, is the
  exalted name-title Jehovah. (Promised Messiah, p. 367)

  ""_Elohim_, plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted
  name-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes his
  supremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods. (Mormon
  Doctrine, p. 224)

        Agreeing with McConkie on the question of who ""Elohim"" and
""Jehovah"" are, the Apostle James E. Talmage stated:

  ""_Elohim_, as understood and used in the restored Church of Jesus
  Christ, is the name-title of God the Eternal Father, whose firstborn
  Son in the spirit is _Jehovah_ -- the Only Begotten in the flesh,
  Jesus Christ. (Jesus the Christ, p. 38)

        ""A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and the Twelve""
apostles of the Mormon Church states that ""God the Eternal Father...[is]
designate[d] by the exalted name-title 'Elohim'..."" (Articles of Faith,
p. 466) ""...Christ in His preexistent, antemortal, or unembodied
state...was known as Jehovah..."" (Articles of Faith, p. 471)

        Today Mormon leaders teach that ""Elohim"" in the OT refers to God
the Father and ""Jehovah"" refers to Christ. McConkie attacked Christians
for saying ""Jehovah"" can refer to the Father. He stressed that these two
""name-titles"" should not be changed around so that Christ is called
""Elohim"" and the Father is called ""Jehovah."" ""...the Father...is Elohim,
not Jehovah.... Jehovah is Christ, and Christ is Jehovah; they are one
and the same person."" (Promised Messiah, p. 111)

        In the OT of the KJV of the Bible, the Hebrew word ""Elohim"" is
used to refer to the true God, false gods and goddesses, and the judges
of Israel. When referring to the true God, ""Elohim"" is translated with a
capital ""G."" When referring to false gods and goddesses and the judges
of Israel, it is translated with a small ""g."" It is translated four
times as ""judges"" (Exod. 21:6; 22:8-9), once as ""judge"" (1 Sam. 2:25),
twice as ""mighty"" (Gen. 23:6; Exod. 9:28), once as ""angels"" (Ps. 8:5),
once as ""godly"" (Mal. 2:15), once as ""great"" (Gen. 30:8), and once as
""very great."" (1 Sam. 14:15)

        The word ""Jehovah"" is the traditional pronunciation of the
tetragrammation YHWH or YHVH with the vowel points taken from the word
""Adonai.""  Many people believe the true pronunciation of the
tetragrammation was Yahweh or Yahveh. However, since ""Jehovah"" rather
than Yahweh is the word used by Mormonism, this section will also use
""Jehovah"" instead of Yahweh to examine the validity of the claims of
Mormon leaders regarding that name. ""Jehovah,"" unlike ""Elohim,"" is never
used of false gods. It is the personal name of the triune God of the
Bible. In the KJV, ""Jehovah"" is rendered primarily ""LORD,"" sometimes
""GOD,"" and rarely ""Lord.""

        Now that we understand something about the words ""Elohim"" and
""Jehovah"" and their use by Mormon leaders, we shall consider the Apostle
McConkie's attack on Christians for believing the Father is ""Jehovah.""
In trying to prove that ""Jehovah"" refers exclusively to Christ, McConkie
cited several verses from the Bible. Some of these verses and McConkie's
interpretation of them will be examined to see whether he was right.
Remember, McConkie said the Father is not ""Jehovah;"" He is only
""Elohim."" The first example we shall consider involves McConkie's
interpretation of Ps. 110:1. Of this verse he stated:

  ""Of whom spake David when his tongue was touched by the Holy Spirit
  and he testified, ""The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right
  hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?"" (Ps. 110:1.) Two
  Lords are here involved: one is speaking to the other; one is greater
  than the other; one is making provision for the triumph and glory of
  the other. Who are they and what message is contained in this
  Messianic prophecy?
  ""What think ye of Christ?"" our Lord asked certain of his detractors
  toward the end of his mortal ministry. ""Whose son is he?"" Is Christ
  the Son of God or of someone else? Is he to be born of a divine Parent
  or will he be as other men -- a mortal son of a mortal father? That he
  was to be a descendant of David was a matter of great pride to all the
  Jews. And so they answered, ""The Son of David.""
  David's son? Truly he was. But he was more, much more. And so our
  Lord, with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture,
  asked, ""How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying, The Lord
  said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine
  enemies thy footstool? If David then call him Lord, how is he his
  son?"" That is, if he is only the Son of David, how is it that the
  great King, acting under inspiration, calls him Lord and worships him
  as such? And we might add: _Who is the other Lord, the one who spake
  unto David's Lord?_ Can there be any question as to how Jesus is
  interpreting the words of the Psalm? He is saying that it means: '_The
  Father said unto the Son, Elohim said unto Jehovah_, sit thou on my
  right hand, until after your mortal ministry; then I will raise you up
  to eternal glory and exaltation with me, where you will continue to
  sit on my right hand forever.' (Promised Messiah, pp. 101-102)
  (emphasis added)

        Agreeing with the above statement by McConkie, the following
remark in the Mormon pamphlet _What the Mormons Think of Christ, p. 6
reads: ""The Lord [Elohim, the Father] said unto my Lord [Jehovah, the
Son]..."" (brackets in original)

        McConkie clearly stated that it is ""Elohim"" the Father who is
speaking to ""Jehovah"" the Son in this Psalm. However, when one looks at
the Hebrew word translated ""LORD,"" it becomes apparent that either the
first ""LORD"" is not the Father or else the Father is ""Jehovah."" Either
way McConkie is wrong. The Psalm reads:

  ""The LORD [Jehovah] said unto my Lord [Adon], Sit thou at my right
  hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. (Ps. 110:1)

        The first ""LORD"" in this verse is ""Jehovah"" who Mormonism says
is Christ, not the Father. The second ""Lord"" is the Hebrew word ""Adon""
(singular for ""Adonai,"" meaning master or lord). If the first ""LORD"" is
the Father and the second ""Lord"" is the Son, then the Father is
""Jehovah"" and the Son is ""Adon."" However, if the Father is not ""Jehovah""
as McConkie claimed, then the first ""LORD"" is ""Jehovah"" the Son, but
who, then, is ""Adon?"" Obviously the Father is ""Jehovah"" in this Psalm,
and His Son is ""Adon.""

        Another example involves Isa. 42:6 about which McConkie stated
the following:

  ""I the Lord have called thee in righteousness,"" _Isaiah quoted the
  Father as saying of Christ_, ""and will hold thine hand, and will keep
  thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the
  Gentiles."" (Isa. 42:6.) (Promised Messiah, p. 81) (emphasis added)

        McConkie said the Father was speaking of Christ in this passage
which reads:

  ""I the LORD [Jehovah] have called thee in righteousness, and will hold
  thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the
  people, for a light of the Gentiles. (Isa. 42:6)

        According to McConkie, ""I the LORD"" refers to the Father, and
""thine"" and ""thee"" refer to Christ. However, the ""LORD"" who is speaking
is ""Jehovah"" which means either McConkie was wrong about who is speaking
or else the Father is ""Jehovah.""

        Another example involves Ps. 22:7-8. Of these verses McConkie
stated:

  ""The same Psalm says: ""All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they
  shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, He trusted on the Lord
  that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in
  him."" (Ps. 22:7-8.) _The fulfillment, as Jesus hung on the cross_, is
  found in these words: ""The chief priests mocking him, with the scribes
  and elders, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be
  the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will
  believe him. He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will
  have him: for he said, I am the Son of God. The thieves also, which
  were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth."" (Matt.
  27:41-44.) (Promised Messiah, pp. 530-531) (emphasis added)

        Ps. 22:7-8 reads as follows:

  ""All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they
  shake the head, saying, He trusted on the LORD [Jehovah] that he would
  deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.

        McConkie said these verses had their fulfillment ""as Jesus hung
on the cross."" That means the person who was scorned in these verses was
Christ. Who, then, was the ""LORD"" in whom he trusted? It was ""Jehovah""
the Father.

        Another example involves Ps. 31:13 and Ps. 41:9. Regarding them,
McConkie stated the following:

  ""With reference to the conniving and conspiring plots incident to our
  Lord's arrest and judicial trials the prophecy was: ""They took counsel
  together against me, they devised to take away my life."" (Ps. 31:13.)
  As to the role of Judas in those conspiracies, the Psalmist says:
  ""Mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my
  bread, hath lifted up his heel against me."" (Ps. 41:9.) (Promised
  Messiah, p. 532)

        Apostle McConkie said these Psalms refer to Christ's ""arrest and
judicial trials."" We shall first consider Ps. 31 and then Ps. 41. While
McConkie only quoted verse 13 of Ps. 31, verse 14 will also be included
to give a complete understanding of the matter.

  ""For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while
  they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my
  life. But I trusted in thee, O LORD [Jehovah]: I said, Thou art my God
  [Elohim]. (Ps. 31:13-14)

        McConkie said verse 13 referred to Jesus Christ. Verse 14 goes
on to tell that He (Christ) trusted in the ""LORD"" who is called His
""God"" or ""Elohim."" Mormonism teaches that the God above Jesus is
""Elohim"" the Father. Verse 14, however, reveals that the ""Elohim"" of the
man Jesus is ""Jehovah"" the Father.

        In Ps. 41, McConkie only quoted one verse; however, two verses
will be considered in this examination.

  ""Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my
  bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.
  But thou, O LORD [Jehovah], be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that
  I may requite them. (Ps. 41:9-10)

        McConkie stated above that verse 9 referred to Judas' role in
Christ's death. Since it was Judas who was the ""familiar friend"" who
""lifted up his heel,"" the pronouns ""mine,"" ""I,"" ""my,"" and ""me"" in verse
9 must refer to Christ. Notice that at the beginning of verse 10 there
is a change of pronoun to ""thou,"" which refers to the ""LORD"" (Jehovah).
Then the pronouns ""me"" and ""I"" which refer to Christ are used again.
That means Christ was speaking to ""Jehovah"" the Father in these verses.

        Another example involves McConkie's following remark about Ps.
        110:4.

  ""One of the great Messianic prophecies, spoken by the mouth of David,
  says: ""The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for
  ever after the order of Melchizedek."" (Ps. 110:4.) (Promised Messiah,
  p. 450)

        McConkie admitted this is a Messianic prophecy involving Christ.
The question is, What in this verse refers to Christ?

  ""The LORD [Jehovah] hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest
  for ever after the order of Melchizedek. (Ps. 110:4)

        Does the ""LORD,"" which is ""Jehovah,"" refer to Christ? If
McConkie is right and Jesus is ""Jehovah,"" but the Father is not, then
the ""LORD"" would have to refer to Christ. But who, then, is the one
addressed as the ""priest forever after the order of Melchizedek?"" The
Bible reveals that the one referred to is Jesus Christ (Heb. 5:8-10;
6:20; 7); therefore, the ""LORD"" (Jehovah) in Ps. 110:4 is the Father.

        Another example involves Isa. 53:4-12. Of these verses McConkie
stated:

  ""Of the atoning sacrifice of the future Messiah, Isaiah said...
     The _Lord_ has laid on him the iniquities of us all....
     It pleased the _Lord_ to bruise him... (Promised Messiah, p. 234)
     (emphasis added)

        McConkie rightly said these verses refer to ""the atoning
sacrifice of the future Messiah."" However, what he failed to mention is
that they also prove that the Father is ""Jehovah."" Verse 6 reads: ""All
we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way;
and the LORD [Jehovah] hath laid on him [Christ] the iniquity of us
all,"" and verse 10 reads: ""Yet it pleased the LORD [Jehovah] to bruise
him [Christ]...""

        Obviously the ""LORD"" who laid on Christ ""the iniquity of us all""
and who bruised Him is God the Father who is called ""Jehovah"" in these
verses.

        Remember, McConkie stated that ""some sectarians even believe
that Jehovah is the Supreme Deity,"" and that Christ ""came into
mortality"" as His ""Only Begotten"" Son. He called this concept
""misinformation"" that is ""untrue."" To prove that it is McConkie who is
misinformed and believing untruth, two Scriptural references (2 Sam.
7:14; Ps. 2:7) will be examined. McConkie stated the following regarding
these Scriptures:

  ""In the midst of a passage that is clearly Messianic, the Lord says of
  the Seed of David: ""I will be his father, and he shall be my son."" (2
  Sam. 7:14.) In the second Psalm, the whole of which is also clearly
  Messianic, occurs this statement: ""Thou art my Son; this day have I
  begotten thee."" (Ps. 2:7.) Paul quotes both of these statements in
  Hebrews 1:5 and says they are prophecies that Christ would come as the
  Son of God. (Promised Messiah, p. 143)

        McConkie cited Heb. 1:5 to show that 2 Sam. 7:14 and Ps. 2:7
refer to Christ who ""would come as the Son of God."" Since McConkie first
referenced 2 Sam. 7:14, this examination will, too. However, along with
verse 14, verses 11-13 will also be included.

  ""And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people
  Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the
  LORD [Jehovah] telleth thee that he will make thee an house.
  And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers,
  I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy
  bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.
  He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of
  his kingdom for ever. I will be his father, and he shall be my son. (2
  Sam. 7:11-14)

        These verses teach that the ""LORD"" (Jehovah) would have a Son,
the Messiah.
        In the second example McConkie cited Ps. 2:7. This examination
will include verse 8. Notice that it is the ""LORD"" (Jehovah) who says,
""Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.""

  ""I will declare the decree: the LORD [Jehovah] hath said unto me, Thou
  art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.
  Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance,
  and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.

        McConkie said these verses of Scripture are ""clearly Messianic,""
and he acknowledged they teach that ""Christ would come as the Son of
God."" What he is not willing to acknowledge, however, is that these
Scriptures also teach that the Father is ""Jehovah"" and that the
""sectarians"" who believe ""Jehovah is the Supreme Deity whose Son"" is
Jesus Christ, ""the Only Begotten,"" are right in their belief.

        Another example involves Mic. 5:4. Of this verse McConkie stated
the following:

  ""And so, truly, did our Lord act _during his mortal ministry! Truly,
  this is he of whom it is written_: ""He shall stand and feed in the
  strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his
  God... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth."" (Mic.
  5:4.) (Promised Messiah, p. 182) (emphasis added)

        According to McConkie, the pronoun ""He"" at the beginning of Mic.
5:4 refers to Christ ""during his mortal ministry."" Who, then, is the
""LORD his God?"" Mic. 5:4 reads:

  ""And he [Christ] shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD
  [Jehovah], in the majesty of the name of the LORD [Jehovah] his God
  [Elohim]... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.

        Obviously the ""LORD"" of Jesus Christ is ""Jehovah"" the Father who
is referred to as ""Jehovah his Elohim.""

        Another example involves Ps. 2:2 and Isa. 61:1. Of these verses
McConkie stated the following:

  ""A number of Messianic passages speak of ""the Lord, and...his
  anointed"" (Ps. 2:2), signifying that the Chosen One was consecrated
  and set apart for the ministry and mission that was his. _Jesus
  applied these passages to himself_ by quoting Isaiah's prophecy. ""The
  Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek"" (Isa.
  61:1), and then saying: ""This day is this scripture fulfilled in your
  ears"" (Luke 4:21). (Promised Messiah, pp. 182-183) (emphasis added)

        The first source McConkie quoted -- Ps. 2:2 -- reads as follows:

  ""The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel
  together, against the LORD [Jehovah], and against his anointed.

        McConkie said the ""anointed"" one was Christ. If that is true,
who was ""Jehovah?"" If ""Jehovah"" is always Christ, who was the ""anointed""
one? Obviously ""Jehovah"" is referring to God the Father and the
""anointed"" is indeed referring to Christ. The second source McConkie
cited is Isa. 61:1 which states:

  ""The Spirit of the Lord [Adonai] GOD [Jehovah] is upon me; because the
  LORD [Jehovah] hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek;
  he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to
  the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;

        The one who was anointed to preach, bind up, proclaim, and open
was Jesus Christ. Who, then, was the one who anointed Him? This verse
says the ""LORD"" (Jehovah) did the anointing. Again, we face the same
problem. If ""Jehovah"" does not refer to the Father, but only to Christ,
then Jesus anointed someone, but who? As McConkie pointed out, ""Jesus
applied these passages to himself."" Therefore, the ""Jehovah"" who
anointed Christ is God the Father.

        Other examples could be cited to show that McConkie and other
Mormon leaders are wrong when they say God the Father is not ""Jehovah.""
However, these should be enough to expose their error.

        Now, what about Mormonism's claim that Jesus is ""Jehovah,"" but
He is not ""Elohim?"" It is true that Jesus is ""Jehovah."" The following
Scriptures prove this fact:

  ""Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] the King of Israel, and his redeemer
  the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and
  beside me there is no God. (Isa. 44:6)
  [Jesus said] ...I am the first and the last: I am he that liveth, and
  was dead... (Rev. 1:17-18)

  ""...saith the LORD [Jehovah]...they shall look upon me whom they have
  pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only
  son... (Zech. 12:1,10)
  Behold, he [Christ] cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him,
  and they also which pierced him... (Rev. 1:7)

  ""...I am the LORD [Jehovah] thy God, the Holy One of Israel... (Isa.
  43:3)
  ...Ye denied the Holy One [Christ] and the Just... (Acts 3:14)

  ""And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of
  the LORD [Jehovah] shall be delivered... (Joel 2:32)
  ""...the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth...there is none other name
  under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. (Acts 4:10,12)

  ""Behold, the Lord GOD [Jehovah] will come with strong hand...his
  reward is with him... (Isa. 40:10)
  ...Behold, I [Christ] come quickly; and my reward is with me... (Rev.
  22:12)

  ""...the LORD [Jehovah] my God shall come, and all the saints with
  thee. (Zech. 14:5)
  ""...at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints. (1
  Thess. 3:13)

  ""The LORD [Jehovah] is my shepherd... (Ps. 23:1)
  [Jesus said] I am the good shepherd... (John 10:14)

  ""...saith the Lord GOD [Jehovah]. I will seek that which was lost...
  (Ezek. 34:15-16)
  ...the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.
  (Luke 19:10)

  ""For I am the LORD [Jehovah] thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy
  Saviour... (Isa. 43:3)
  Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great
  God and our Saviour Jesus Christ. (Tit. 2:13. See also Jer. 42:5 and
  Rev. 1:5; Mal. 3:6 and Heb. 13:8; 1 Kin. 8:28,39 and John 2:24-25;
  Isa. 25:8 and 2 Tim. 1:10; Ps. 107:24,29 and Matt. 8:26; Prov.3:12 and
  Rev. 3:19)

        While Mormons are right when they say Jesus is ""Jehovah,"" they
are wrong when they say He is not ""Elohim."" The Bible reveals that
""Jehovah"" is the only true ""Elohim"" there is; all others are false.
Remember, ""Jehovah"" is the personal name of the triune God who has
revealed Himself in the Bible.

        Before we consider Biblical quotes which show that ""Jehovah"" and
""Elohim"" are not two separate gods as Mormons claims let us first note
that not only are both God the Father and Christ addressed as ""Jehovah""
and ""Elohim"" but so is the Holy Spirit.

  ""Whereof the _Holy Ghost_..._said_...This _is_ the covenant that I
  will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my
  laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them; And
  their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. (Heb. 10:15-17)
  (emphasis on ""Holy Ghost"" and ""said"" added)
  Behold, the days come, _saith the LORD_ [Jehovah], that I will make a
  new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah...
  I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts;
  and will be their God [Elohim], and they shall be my people.... I will
  forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more. (Jer.
  31:31,33-34) (emphasis added)

  ""For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy
  men of God spake as they were moved by the _Holy Ghost_. (2 Pet. 1:21)
  (emphasis on ""Holy Ghost"" added)
  ""The Spirit of the LORD [Jehovah] spake by me, and his word was in
  my tongue. (2 Sam. 23:2. See also Heb. 3:7-11 with Ps. 95:6-11)

        Let us now continue with the Biblical quotes which show that
""Jehovah"" and ""Elohim"" are not two separate gods as Mormons claim.

  ""And when the LORD [Jehovah] saw that he [Moses] turned aside to see,
  God [Elohim] called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said,
  Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.... [Bruce R. McConkie
  acknowledged that ""it was"" Christ's ""voice that spoke to Moses in the
  burning bush..."" Promised Messiah, p. 394]
  And the LORD [Jehovah] said...
  And Moses said unto God [Elohim], Behold, when I come unto the
  children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God [Elohim] of your
  fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his
  name? what shall I say unto them?
  And God [Elohim] said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus
  shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto
  you.
  And God [Elohim] said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto
  the children of Israel, the LORD [Jehovah] God [Elohim] of your
  fathers, the God [Elohim] of Abraham, the God [Elohim] of Isaac, and
  the God [Elohim] of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for
  ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations. (Exod.
  3:4,7,13-15)

  ""And God [Elohim] spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD
  [Jehovah]. (Exod. 6:2)

  ""I am the LORD [Jehovah], and there is none else, there is no God
  [Elohim] beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:
  (Isa. 45:5)

  ""But the LORD [Jehovah] is the true God [Elohim], he is the living God
  [Elohim], and an everlasting king... (Jer. 10:10)

  ""Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] the King of Israel, and his redeemer
  the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and
  beside me there is no God [Elohim]. (Isa. 44:6)

  ""Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus,
  saith the LORD [Jehovah], whose name is The God [Elohim] of hosts.
  (Amos 5:27)

  ""Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD's
  [Jehovah's] thy God [Elohim], the earth also, with all that therein
  is. (Deut. 10:14)

  ""Wherefore thou art great, O LORD [Jehovah] God [Elohim]: for there is
  none like thee, neither is there any God [Elohim] beside thee,
  according to all that we have heard with our ears. (2 Sam. 7:22)

  ""And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD [Jehovah],
  the God [Elohim] of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land.
  (Jon. 1:9)

  ""For who is God [Elohim] save the LORD [Jehovah]? or who is a rock
  save our God [Elohim]? (Ps. 18:31)

  ""Blessed is the nation whose God [Elohim] is the LORD [Jehovah]...
  (Ps. 33:12. See also Ps. 144:15)

  ""Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God
  [Elohim], the LORD [Jehovah], the Creator of the ends of the earth,
  fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his
  understanding. (Isa. 40:28)

  ""The mighty God [Elohim], even the LORD [Jehovah], hath spoken, and
  called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down
  thereof. (Ps. 50:1)

  ""Sing unto God [Elohim], sing praises to his name: estol him that
  rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him. (Ps.
  68:4) [Regarding the word ""Jah,"" Bruce R. McConkie stated: ""Jah
  (Hebrew Yah) is a contracted form of Jehovah, Jahveh, or Yahweh -- all
  of which names have reference to Christ, the God of Israel."" Mormon
  Doctrine, p. 391]

  ""And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from
  Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God [Elohim], whose
  name is called by the name of the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts that
  dwelleth between the cherubims. (2 Sam. 6:2)

  ""...the Great the Mighty God [Elohim], the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts, is
  his name. (Jer. 32:18)

  ""O my God [Elohim], make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the
  wind....
  Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD
  [Jehovah]....
  That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most
  high over all the earth. (Ps. 83:13,16,18)

        The Bible clearly teaches that ""Jehovah"" is ""Elohim."" In fact,
He is the only ""Elohim"" there is. He is the ""true,"" the ""living,"" the
""mighty,"" the ""great,"" and the ""everlasting Elohim."" He is the ""Elohim""
of Israel, of all the kingdoms of the earth, and of the heavens. He is
the Creator who made the heavens and all their host and the earth and
all that dwell thereon. ""Jehovah's"" name is ""Elohim of hosts."" (Amos
5:27)

        Not only is ""Jehovah,"" ""Elohim,"" but ""Elohim"" is ""Jehovah."" The
Bible reveals that ""Elohim's"" name is ""Jah"" (Ps. 68:4), ""Jehovah"" (Ps.
83:18), and ""Jehovah of hosts."" (2 Sam. 6:2; Jer. 32:18)   The nation
whose ""Elohim"" is ""Jehovah"" is blessed. (Ps. 33:12) Clearly, this is not
the ""Jehovah"" and ""Elohim"" of the Mormons.

        Another Mormon error regarding ""Elohim"" and ""Jehovah"" is the
belief that ""Elohim,"" not ""Jehovah,"" is the Father of all the spirits,
including Jesus. In the Articles of Faith by Apostle James E. Talmage,
""A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and The Twelve"" apostles
states that ""God the Eternal Father...'Elohim,' is the literal Parent
of...the spirits of the human race."" (p. 466) This ""Doctrinal
Exposition"" also states explicitly that ""Jesus Christ is not the Father
of the spirits who have taken or yet shall take bodies upon this earth,
for He is one of them. He is The Son, as they are sons and daughters of
Elohim."" (p. 473)

        The Apostle Talmage stated that ""_Elohim_...is the name-title of
God the Eternal Father, whose firstborn Son in the spirit is
_Jehovah_--"" (Jesus the Christ, p. 38)

        The Apostle Bruce R. McConkie stated the following about this
matter: ""...Jehovah-Christ...did in fact create the earth and all forms
of plant and animal life on the face thereof. _But when it came to
placing man on earth, there was a change in Creators_. That is, the
Father himself became personally involved. All things were created by
the Son, using the power delegated by the Father, except man. _In the
spirit and again in the flesh, man was created by the Father_. There was
no delegation of authority where the crowning creature of creation was
concerned."" (Promised Messiah, p. 62) (emphasis added)

        Mormon leaders claim that ""Jehovah-Christ"" did not create either
man's spirit or his body. They maintain that the Mormon ""Elohim,"" who is
the father, created man both in spirit and body. The Bible reveals the
truth about who created man.

  ""And Moses spake unto the LORD [Jehovah], saying,
  Let the LORD [Jehovah], the God [Elohim] of the _spirits of all
  flesh_, set a man over the congregation. (Num. 27:15-16. See also
  16:20-23) (emphasis added)

  ""...the LORD [Jehovah], which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth
  the foundation of the earth, and _formeth the spirit of man within
  him_. (Zech. 12:1) (emphasis added)

  ""...the LORD [Jehovah]...made us this soul... (Jer. 38:16)

  ""For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for
  the spirit should fail before me, and the _souls which I have
  made_....
  ...saith the LORD [Jehovah]... (Isa. 57:16,19) (emphasis on ""souls...I
  have made"" added)

  ""Behold, I am the LORD [Jehovah], the God [Elohim] _of all flesh_...
  (Jer. 32:27) (emphasis added)

  ""Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], thy redeemer, and he that _formed thee
  from the womb_.
  I am the LORD [Jehovah] that maketh all things... (Isa. 44:24)
  (emphasis added)

  ""Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah]...
  I have made the earth, and _created man_ upon it... (Isa. 45:11-12)
  (emphasis added)

  ""...God [Elohim] created man upon the earth...
  Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD
  [Jehovah] he is God [Elohim]; there is none else beside him. (Deut.
  4:32,35)

  ""Thus saith God [El] the LORD [Jehovah]...he that spread forth the
  earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the
  people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein. (Isa. 42:5)

  ""...Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts, the God [Elohim] of
  Israel... I have made the earth, _the man_ and the beast that are upon
  the ground... (Jer. 27:4-5) (most emphasis added)

        The Bible reveals that it is ""Jehovah"" who is the ""Elohim of the
spirits of all flesh"" and ""of all flesh"" itself, that it was He who
""formed the spirit of man within him,"" that He ""made us this soul"" and
""formed us from the womb."" He did indeed ""create man.""

        If Mormon leaders are right when they say Jesus is ""Jehovah,""
then they are wrong when they say he did not create man. If they are
right when they say the father is the one who created man, then they are
wrong when they say he is not ""Jehovah.""

        Although Mormon leaders teach that Jesus did not create man,
Mormon scriptures teach that he did. The BoM states the following:

  ""Behold, I am Jesus Christ. I am the Father and the Son....
  And never have I showed myself unto _man whom I have created_, for
  never has man believed in me as thou hast....
  Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and
  _man have I created_ after the body of my spirit... (Eth. 3:14-16)
  (emphasis added)

  ""For it is I that taketh upon me the sins of the world; for it is _I
  that hath created them_... (Mos. 26:23) (emphasis added)

  ""...the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of
  Jacob...is that same God who created the heavens and the earth, and
  all things that in them are.
  Behold _he created Adam_... (Mor. 9:11-12) (emphasis added)

        D&C, 93:10 states that ""the worlds were made by him [Christ];
_men were made by him_; all things were made by him, and through him,
and of him."" (emphasis added)

        Another error by Bruce R. McConkie involving ""Jehovah"" and his
creation is the belief that ""Jehovah"" had ""many"" pre-mortal spirits
helping him create. Included in this alleged group was Joseph Smith, Jr.

  ""That he [Christ] was aided in the creation of this earth by ""many of
  the noble and great"" spirit children of the Father is evident from
  Abraham's writings. Unto those superior spirits Christ said: ""We will
  go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these
  materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell."" (Abra.
  3:22-24.) Michael or Adam was one of these. Enoch, Noah, Abraham,
  Moses, Peter, James, and John, Joseph Smith, and many other ""noble and
  great"" ones played a part in the great creative enterprise. (Doctrines
  of Salvation, vol. 1, pp. 74-75.) (Mormon Doctrine, p. 169)

        The Bible reveals the truth about this matter:

  ""Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], thy redeemer, and he that formed thee
  from the womb, I am the LORD [Jehovah] that maketh all things; that
  stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by
  myself. (Isa. 44:24)

  ""Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of
  the sea. (Job 9:8)

        ""Jehovah,"" by Himself, created all things. He had no alleged
preexistent spirit helpers assisting Him.

        Regarding the Mormon 'Elohim,"" the Apostle McConkie stated:
""Elohim. plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted
name-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes his
supremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods."" (Mormon
Doctrine, p. 224) He also stated that ""Jesus...is above all save the
Father only."" (Promised Messiah, p. 363)

        The Bible states that the One who is God above all so-called
gods is the triune God ""Jehovah.""

  ""For the LORD [Jehovah] is a great God [El], and a great King above
  all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 95:3)

  ""For thou, LORD [Jehovah], art high above all the earth: thou art
  exalted far above all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 97:9)

  ""Now I know that the LORD [Jehovah] is greater than all gods
  [Elohim]... (Exod. 18:11. See also Ps. 135:5; Deut. 10:17)

        If Mormon leaders are right when they say ""Jehovah"" is god the
son and ""Elohim"" is god the father, these verses from the Bible would be
teaching that the Mormon son is above his father. However, as McConkie
clearly stated, Mormons believe ""Elohim"" the father, not ""Jehovah"" the
son, is the ""God above all Gods"" -- that Jesus is above all except the
father; yet the Bible teaches that ""Jehovah"" is above all ""Elohim.""

        At a BYU Dev. on March 2, 1982, Bruce R. McConkie made the
following remark about praying to Jesus:

  ""Another peril is that those so involved often begin to pray directly
  to Christ because of some special friendship they feel has been
  developed....
  This is plain sectarian nonsense. Our prayers are addressed to the
  Father, and to him only....
  ...Perfect prayer is addressed to the Father, in the name of the Son;
  it is uttered by the power of the Holy Ghost... (Our Relationship With
  the Lord, pp. 19-20)

        McConkie states on p. 335 of his book Promised Messiah that the
Mormons ""pray to the Father, not the Son..."" On p. 306 of the same book
McConkie states that ""Christ [the Son] is Jehovah."" This is important to
remember, because although McConkie said prayer is not to be offered to
the Mormon Christ who is ""Jehovah,"" the Bible states repeatedly in the
OT that people prayed to ""Jehovah,"" and He not only heard those prayers,
but He accepted them as valid requests. The following is but a small
sample of the vast number of times people prayed to ""Jehovah.""

  ""In my distress I called upon the LORD [Jehovah], and cried unto my
  God [Elohim]: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came
  before him, even into his ears. (Ps. 18:6)

  ""And the LORD [Jehovah] said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy
  supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this
  house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine
  eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually. (1 Kin. 9:3)

  ""And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our
  supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD
  [Jehovah] thy God [Elohim], even for all this remnant... (Jer. 42:2)

  ""O LORD [Jehovah], I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to
  the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who
  desire to fear thy name... (Neh. 1:11)

  ""And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this
  prayer and supplication unto the LORD [Jehovah], he arose from before
  the altar of the LORD [Jehovah], from kneeling on his knees with his
  hands spread up to heaven. (1 Kin. 8:54)

  ""He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed
  unto the LORD [Jehovah]. (2 Kin. 4:33)

  ""Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], the God
  [Elohim] of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy
  tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years. (Isa. 38:5)

  ""I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I
  said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD [Jehovah]; and
  thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.
  For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when
  thou mayest be found... (Ps. 32:5-6)

        Notice above in Ps. 32:6 that the ""godly"" pray to ""Jehovah.""
According to McConkie and other Mormon leaders, that is Christ the very
one to whom McConkie said people should not pray.

        The Bible reveals there is only one true ""Elohim,"" and His name
is ""Jehovah."" All other ""Elohim"" are false. They are idols that cause
their followers to commit adultery against the true ""Elohim"" and
idolatry.

  ""For the LORD [Jehovah] is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to

  They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me:
  for if thou serve their gods [Elohim], it will surely be a snare unto

  ""Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn

  ""That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you;
  neither make mention of the name of their gods [Elohim], nor cause to

  ""...neither walk after other gods [Elohim] to your hurt. (Jer. 7:6)

  ""But the LORD [Jehovah] is the true God [Elohim], he is the living God

  ""And they forsook the LORD [Jehovah] God [Elohim] of their fathers,
  which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods
  [Elohim], of the gods [Elohim] of the people that were round about
  them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD [Jehovah]
  to anger. (Jud. 2:12)

  ""Shall a man make gods [Elohim] unto himself, and they are no gods

  ""And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD [Jehovah], choose you
  this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods [Elohim] which your
  fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods
  [Elohim] of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my
  house, we will serve the LORD [Jehovah].
  And the people answered and said, God [Elohim] forbid that we should
  forsake the LORD [Jehovah], to serve other gods [Elohim]. (Josh.
  24:15-16)

        These verses teach that the only true, living ""Elohim"" in heaven
and on earth is ""Jehovah"" -- the triune God who made heaven and earth
and all therein.

        ""Jehovah"" is greater than any ""Elohim,"" because all other
""Elohim"" are idols. The reality behind them is demonic. (Deut. 32:17)
""Jehovah Elohim"" has given explicit warnings and guidelines regarding
these false ""Elohim."" He told His people not to have any ""Elohim"" but
Him. He told the people that if they left Him for the false ""Elohim,""
those ""Elohim"" would be a snare to them, and they would be hurt and
would perish. He warned the people to ""take heed"" that their ""heart be
not deceived"" into worshiping, serving, swearing by, and making
covenants with false ""Elohim."" ""Jehovah Elohim"" told His people He would
eventually judge all false ""Elohim"" and their followers.

        Despite these warnings and guidelines, ""Elohim's"" covenant
people forsook Him and believed in and worshiped the false ""Elohim's"" of
the people they came in contact with. Ju. 10:6 states that ""the children
of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah] and served
Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods [Elohim] of Syria, and the gods
[Elohim] of Zidon, and the gods [Elohim] of Moab, and the gods [Elohim]
of the children of Ammon, and the gods [Elohim] of the Philistines, and
forsook the LORD [Jehovah], and served not him.""

        This examination has shown that the ""Elohim"" of Mormonism, like
the ""Elohim"" in Ju. 10:6 is not the true ""Jehovah Elohim."" Therefore,
the people who leave the true ""Elohim"" for the Mormon ""Elohim"" will do
""evil...in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah].""

        Although McConkie attacked Christians for their belief in a
triune God who is Spirit and for their belief that God the Father
[Jehovah] sent His Son into the world, these beliefs are true. God is
triune; He is Spirit; He is ""Jehovah;"" and He did send His Son into the
world to redeem mankind.

        It is obvious from this examination that it is not the
Christians who ""thrash around in...darkness"" about who ""Elohim"" and
""Jehovah"" are. One wonders what ""Holy Writ"" McConkie had in mind when he
stated that it attests to the fact that ""Elohim is the Father, and that
Jehovah is the Son."" He certainly did not mean the Bible which teaches
that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are all the one ""Jehovah Elohim.""
He apparently did not mean the D&C either, because chapter 109, verses
1,4,9-10, 14,19,22,24,29,34,42,47,56,68,77 refer to the Father as
""Jehovah.""

Summary

        Obviously Joseph Fielding Smith's statement that the Mormons
""have a clear and perfect understanding of the nature of God"" (Doctrines
of Salvation, 1:279) is not accurate. The Mormon gods are not the true
God as Mormonism claims, but are idols which cause their followers to
commit adultery against God and idolatry.

        In answer to Jesus' question, ""But whom say ye that I am,""
Mormons say Jesus is someone different from the Jesus who is revealed in
the Bible and whom the apostles preached. Therefore, anyone trusting in
the Mormon Jesus is believing in ""another Jesus"" whom Paul warned about.

        Bernard P. Brockbank, of the First Quorum of the Seventy,
admitted in the May 1977 issue of The Ensign, a Mormon publication, that
the Mormon Jesus is different from the Christian Jesus. He stated that
""it is true that many of the Christian churches worship a different
Jesus Christ than is worshipped by the Mormons or The Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints."" (p. 26)

        The people who believe in the Mormon Jesus are committing
adultery against God and idolatry. They do not have the Son; therefore,
they do not have the Father, and they do not have eternal life. As the
Apostle Bruce R. McConkie rightly stated: ""Salvation comes only by
worshiping the true God."" (Promised Messiah, p. 163) McConkie also
rightly stated that ""the mere worship of a god who has the proper
scriptural names does not assure one that he is worshiping the true and
living God,"" because the ""true names of Deity"" can be applied to ""false
concepts of God."" (Mormon Doctrine, p. 270) Remember that the Apostle
Stephen L. Richards admitted that Joseph Smith, Jr., gave ""a new
conception of God and the Godhead."" (Contributions of Joseph Smith, p.
1)

        It is important for the people who have left the true triune God
revealed in the Bible to repent and return to Him. They must forsake the
sins of idolatry and adultery which they are committing in Mormonism.
The Bible says:

  ""...all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from
  me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD
  [Jehovah], the fountain of living waters. (Jer. 17:13)

  ""And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD [Jehovah] thy God
  [Elohim], and walk after other gods [Elohim], and serve them, and
  worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely
  perish. (Deut. 8:19)

  ""Thou shalt make no covenant with...their gods [Elohim]. (Exod. 23:32)

  ""...Put away the strange gods [Elohim] that are among you, and be
  clean, and change your garments. (Gen. 35:2)

  ""...flee from idolatry. (1 Cor. 10:14)

        It is necessary that Christians heed the warnings of the Bible.
If they do, they will not fall into the sins of adultery against God and
idolatry. Remember, to know the ""only true God"" is eternal life. (John
17:3)

  ""...their gods [Elohim] shall be a snare unto you."" (Ju. 2:3. See also
  Exod. 23:32-33)

If what was being discussed could be established or disproven by 
experiment and observation, then I would agree with you, Chris.  
The burden of proof would belong to Bill. But the source
document for Christianity, the Bible, simply assumes God exists
and makes it clear (to us Calvinists, anyway :-)) that when a person
is in fellowship with God, it is because God has taken the initiative
in revealing Himself to that person. So from a Christian point of
view, the burden of proof belongs to God. Bill is being consistent
with what the Bible teaches in relating his own experience with God,
but it would be an error on his part to assume that there is a direct,
causal relationship between his testimony and someone else becoming
convinced that God exists and that he needs to be reconciled to God.

Please excuse me if I missed an earlier part of this thread
in which Bill came across like an egotist. What I saw was simply
obedience to the scriptural command to ""always be ready

	I'm not sure that you can distinguish between myth and legend so
neatly, or at all.  A myth is more than a single story.  The thought 
structure and world-paradigm in which that story is interpreted is as
important a part of the myth as the story itself.  Thus, I can think of
no story which is meant to be conveyed understandably from one person
to another within a single culture which won't rest upon that underlying
thought structure, and thus transmit some of that culture's mythical
""truths"" along with it.

I am not exactly known as a Flower Child Pacifist, but lets call
cowpoop cowpoop.

""The peaceful attempt to serve the warrant"" consisted of the following
actions, in order:

1) BATF agents forcing their entry of the ""compound"" through second
story windows.

2) BATF agents loosing some grenades (allegedly ""stun"" or ""flash""
grenades) which promptly detonated.

*After* which, according to the tapes I have seen, the B-D
started shooting back.

Now exactly how is it that someone breaking into private property
and tossing grenades around is considered ""peaceful"" by
*anyone*? You *think* on that.

(Which is not to say I do not still hold my previous and
entirely correct notions about what should be worn and
what arms should be used in assaulting a building.)

The point about its being real or not is that one does not waste time with
what reality might be when one wants predictions. The questions if the
atoms are there or if something else is there making measurements indicate
atoms is not necessary in such a system.
 
And one does not have to write a new theory of existence everytime new

Humorous, this notion of an all-knowing, all-powerful god who must
""attempt"" to ""reconcile"" with his lowly creations.  I realize that it
is not possible to penetrate such logic, but is there any chance that
you might consider that an omnipotent god need not ""attempt"" anything,
and further that an attempt to ""reconcile"" implies a lack of
omniscience?

What you are doing here is projecting human weaknesses onto your god.

But all humans are sinners, thus all pre-Jesus humans should have been
punished with death.  We aren't punished with sin now, of course,
because God has changed.  He required a brutal, sadistic sacrifice of
his own blood in order to allow us to sin without immediate death.  

>He cannot tolerate the prescence of sin in His midst.  

Yet he does so now.  He has changed.  The sadistic murder of his own
son has made him more tolerant of our sins.

Besides, his ""midst"" is everywhere, so your statement is meaningless.
He tolerates sin in Hell, which surely is in his midst as well.  Also,
given that he is all-knowing, he must have eternal knowledge of who
will commit which sins, as well as when and where, so what does
tolerance have to do with anything.  All of this is absolute nonsense,
unless your god is not indeed all-knowing and all-powerful, or unless
he doesn't take the personal interest in everyday affairs that you
claim.

>And the Israelites knew this!  And

Not relevant.  The claim of kindness and lovingness was made by you in
reference to your god.  The nature of his creations/victims is not at
issue.

Death and/or eternal damnation is your idea of correctional

This is quite an elaborate fantasy that you've constructed, but sadly

My understanding of the academic use of the word cult is that it is
a group of people oriented around a single authority figure. It need
not be religious. However, I have seen plenty of religious cults,
including some that mainstream.

Then we all live happily ever after. :-)

Seriously, if we all agreed on the circumstances we're in, I suspect we'd all
agree on the best course of action.  Unfortunately, I have no confidence that
such a situation will ever arise. 

Some of us think there's a big God in the sky, some don't.  Some think
they've been chosen by God, others disagree.  Some think they are infallible,
others think otherwise.  Until those disagreements over circumstances can be
ironed out, there's little hope of everyone agreeing.

Yes.  I think that, for example, only a vanishingly small number of people
would hold that there's a frame of reference in which gassing six million
Jews is good.  So that's probably about as close to an objective moral value
as I've encountered in my life so far.

Well, I think your example's poor.  If the bomb's in Iraq, for example, and

act.

Right, and the chain ends right there.  The buck stops with me.  It's not an

Right.  The key point, however, is that there are vanishingly few of these
moral issues where we can get 99.9% of people to agree on the outcome for all
frames of reference (and agree on the frames of reference...)

I can't manage either.  Killing Hitler using a car bomb would have been a

I think that circumstances have already arisen where terrorism would have
been better than peace.  Better in terms of numbers of innocent people
killed.  Assuming it was successful terrorism, of course.

Then you lie to yourself.  You do not know your shortcomings.  I have clearly
shown one of your shortcomings, if not two.  That is, ignorance of the Bible
and the arrogance you demonstrate butchering it without even knowing its 
contents.

> I regard Christ as a myth. 

Because you have been too prideful to examine the record of him for yourself.
And to demonstate your lack of support for your conclusion, I bet you do not
even know what the word ""Christ"" means.  Or which prophet used ""Christ"" to 
describe the ""Son of Man"".

Yes.  I agree with that.  So we must learn first.  Read the Bible.  Come
up with our own interpretation.   Evaluate what is being said
and by whom.  Check the history books as well.  Compare someone else's
interpretation with your own.  Then make a judgment.  But I tell you the
truth, 99% of what is being said in the Bible needs interpretation as 
much as a coffee cup needs interpretation.

And remember, the Bible isn't a Guru's Esoteric Guide to Metaphysics.  
It doesn't take a theologian to understand what is being said.    The 
Bible is a bunch of testimonies from people like you and I addressed 
to people like you and I.  These guys wrote down what they saw and heard.  Is it 
their open diary--and they want to tell you something.  And because they
want you to know something, they make it very clear what they want you to
know.   They didn't encouch their ideas in esoteric rhetoric, but in simple
straight-forward language.

You have chosen the road that avoids the Bible.  You have chosen the
road that avoids a confrontation with the living God because that
road doesn't look appealing to you.  You rather build your own road.  One
that goes far away from that confrontation.   But be assured of this,
you will have to confront him one day willingly or unwillingly.

I see what you mean.  I hear what your saying.  I am not degrading your
life.  But I have heard the same irrational excuses for years.  There is nothing 
new in what you are saying.  And by your own words, you are ""spouting off"" 
contradictions.   If contradictions give you meaning, then your life must
be sad.

Bingo.  For God so loved the world, he GAVE his only begotton to son
so that whososever belives in him will have ever lasting life.   I look
what God *did*.  He has given his Son, even to his death, so that I can have

Because you turn your eyes away from testimony and history.  You choose to
lie to yourself that he doesn't exist, for you ignore what has been said for 
thousands of years.  You sound exactly, almost verbatim, like the Lazarus of 
Jesus's story starting in Luke 16:19.  And the conclusion of that story is a 
bleak one.  Lazarus wound up in hell.  The story ends like this:

      ""For if Lazarus doesn't even listen to Moses and the Prophets,
       he won't even believe if a man rose from the dead.""

Arrogance at its best.   The fact is, you are not rational.  Several specific
cases  have already been cited.   And again with this new statement, you show more irrationality with regards to heaven.  Jesus does tell you something of what to expect
in heaven.  Jesus expects you to use your brain to believe in him.  Jesus does
not expect you to placate either.  Jesus wants you to willingly come to him, but not
as his grovelling slave, but rather as his brother who will share in his
glorious riches.  Why do you not pick up the Bible and read it for yourself.  
You maintain you have an open mind.  See whether you are lying to yourself for
yourself.

I do understand what you said.   But that's is not what I feel went amiss here.

You missed the point.  Living a ""good life"" has no eternal consequences.
Once they close the amusement park of life, to you that is the end.  To you, it 
is over.  To you, therefore, your time spent in the amusement park is meaningless. 
It has no eternal consequences to you nor to anyone left on earth. 

But then you contradict yourself.  From a previous post, you said doing evil things 
is bad.  To you, it shouldn't matter if you do evil things or good things.  It is
all meaningless in the end anyway.  So go rob a bank.  Go tell someone
you dislike that he is a dirty rotten slime bag.  What's restraining you?
Life after all, has no eternal consequences and accountability is irrelevant.

So you (and your holy book) say.  By the same token, therefore, Santa
Claus delivers toys every xmas.  Don't you see?  I have NO REASON to
believe that what you say is true.  Please give me some reason that I
can't similarly apply to Santa Claus.

You have EVERY reason to believe that what Jesus says and the witnesses
of Jesus say are true.  But you choose to be unreasonable and ""ignore"" the
reasons.  By definition, ""ignorance"". 

Santa Claus is said to live at the North Pole and have a squad of elves
and flying reindeer.   Ever see a flying reindeer?  Has anyone in human
history seen a flying reindeer?  Has anyone seen a reindeer whose nose 
blinks red?    

On the other hand, are people born in Bethlehem?  Was Nebuchandezzar really
a king?  Was Daniel really one of his court officials?  Were David and Solomon
really kings of Israel and Judah?  Was their really a king called Jehoachin?
Did Sennecherib really attack Jerusalem 600 years before Christ?  Did
Sennacherib really lose his battle--and badly?   Was there really a 
Caiaphas who interrogated Jesus?   Yes, yes, yes . . . history verifies
it.  It is NONFICTION.

Do you have a problem discerning truth from fiction?  Perhaps you
can't evaluate the context of Grimm's Fairy Tales apart from
that of the Scientific American.  I suppose you treat both with equal
truthfulness or equal falsity.  Is this what you are telling me?  Or
is it that just do want to read the Scientific American and find out
that it's not a fairy tale?

>Are you thereby inferring that your deity is nothing more than a

Get real.  Have you ever been to Zaire?  Do you have to go there
to be  assured that there really is such a place?  Given your 
irrationality, I take it you have never used a map in your life.

> Why do you believe what you believe?

Given the overwhelming evidence as well as my personal experience with the living
God, I'd be an irrational unreasoning ignorant fool if I didn't follow Jesus.

That is indeed the present consensus.  Contrary to what Dr. Fox has
been saying, however, present consensus is *not* that the longer
passage in Josephus about Jesus was inserted, but only that it was
modified.
   There is no question that it was *at least* modified (based on what
Origen says--that Josephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah), but
I don't think the argument that it appears ""out of context"" is a very
good one.  (I haven't looked at the context for a while; perhaps somebody
could give some of the sentences which precede and follow the Jesus
passage.)

Brian, have you checked out what your priests told you in the
Bible to see whether they were telling you the truth?  Did you know
that according to the Bible, there shouldn't even be such things as
""priests"" anymore?  Do you know why the preisthood was established in
the Old Testament to begin with and the reasons why after Jesus,
there were no priests--that is until the Roman Catholic Church 
300 years later devised the doctrine of transubstantiation by ignoring
the whole concept beyond the book of Hebrews?

You said you analyzed the Bible very closely.  I think you are
lying.  For if you had, I would think you would have at least
got the doctrine of hell straight.

So what is your beef against Jesus?  Be specific and point on
verses.

I'm curious.  Are you referring to Koresh as ""the Man""?  Why the 
upper case M?

I never claimed to be a spokesman for ""most people"".  It is an assumption
on my part that people with normal values and morality would be more 
concerned with human life than sermon structure.

What about those who do not know the Master's voice?  Does the Master
not care about them?  Eloquent, but corrupt, preaching may be of little
difference to you.  But I suspect it made a big difference to all of
those who died in the compound.

Last night CNN reported that FBI has infrared pictures showing
that the fires started in three places at the same time. That 
would indicate something not resembling an accident.

I'm for the moment interested in this notion of the 'leap of faith'
established by Kierkegaard. It clearly points out a possible solution
to transcendental values. What I don't understand is that it also
clearly shows the existentialism system where any leap to any
transcendental direction is equal. 

In other words I might not jump off the cliff mentioned above,
but at the same time I will decide to what direction I will go.
Actually I will do it just now.

I recently watched a an episode of ""The Old West"" a TV show on the 
Discovery Channel (or perhaps the A&E Network), the one hosted by Kenny
Rogers.  This episode was all about the Mormons and how they settled Utah,
etc.

A large portion of the broadcast was about the ""Mountain Meadows Massacre"".
The program very specifically pointed out that Brigham Young knew nothing
about the incident until long after it had happened (before telegraph), and
it occured as a result of several men inciting a bunch of paronoid Moromn
settlers into what amounted to a mob.  All participants in the incident were
prosecuted and eccomunicated from the LDS Church.

I suggest you watch a rerun of that episode (they play them over and over) 
and see what they (non-Mormons) have to say about it.

Yes, one does.  I examined a critique of the Book of Romans by
I think, Benjamin Franklin once, a Deist.  I found it amazing that
Benjamin Franklin missed the whole boat.   I also have the writings
on Thomas Jefferson sitting on my shelf, and it is amazing how
much he missed.  I have studied Plato's Theory of Forms and 
Aristotelian Hylomorphesism.  What a pile of junk.  Jesus
makes Plato and Aristotle look like kindergardeners.  Psychology,
the id, ego, superego by Freud?  Elements of truth, but Jesus
explained it far better and gave reasons.

Thomas Paine, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson are mere men.  They
can screw up the Bible just as well as any man.  I do not put these
men on a pedestal.  And if I remember T.J.'s autobiography correctly,
he thought Thomas Paine was the most unread man he ever met.

Here's some more circular reasoning to you.  Paul says to the Corinthians
that ""that the gospel will be foolishness to the world, because it is 
spiritually discerned.""  And so, people without the spirit of God haven't a
clue to what the Bible is saying.   From your point of view, that's
incredibly circular and convenient.   To me, it is mysteriously and supernaturally
bizarre.   I can see it, but you can't.  This is not arrogance on
my part.  Trust me.  It is as bizarre to you as it is to me.  But nonetheless,
it is a truth, explainable or not.

Are any of you color blind to red and green?  I am.  Remember those
dot tests they do at the optomologist's?  They put pictures in front
of you and you are supposed to identify the pattern in the dots?  If
your eyes are perfectly normal, you can see letters or numerals
embedded in the dots.  They are a slightly different color and stand
out from the background.  But if you are color blind to red and green,
you will not see anything but gray-shaded dots.  That is how a dot
test appears to me.  I do not see a pattern at all.

A normal seeing person will see the patterns.  And to him, I seem like a
total anomaly.  To him, I appear as if I am missing the universe or something.
It is hard for him to understand why I can't see anything
that to him is as plain as day.

That it what it is like with the Bible, the Word of God, to the believer.
The believer can see the meaning in the words.  I can see how the patterns
fit together.  There is such depth.  Such consistency.   But then, on the
other hand, I notice the non-believer.   He doesn't see it.  He thinks
I am weird because he thinks I am seeing things.   I look at him, and
say, ""No, you are weird.  You do not see.""   Then it is time for a sanity
check.  I go to another Christian and say, ""Do you see this.""  And
they go, ""Yes.  It is an ""X"""".  And I say, ""Thank God, I see the ""X""
too.""

It is truly the strangest thing.   It adds a little extra dimension to
the phrase, 

         ""He will make the blind see, and the deaf hear.""


I am glad that Jesus has enabled me to see.  I wish every non-believer
could see what they are missing.

Dear me. This is taken _so_ out of context that it's hard to know where
to start... The quote starts with material from p 78, and ends with material
from page 81!

On page 78, there's the bit that says (the parts left out in John King's
""quote"" are marked by <>):
""<...> the doubt that has infiltrated the previous, smugly confident certitude
of evolutionary biology<'s last twenty years> has inflamed passions <and
provoked some very interesting thought and research>.""

Eldridge goes on immediately following the butchered quote:
""In short, evolutionary biology has entered a phase of creativity that is
the hallmark of good, active science.""

The material that is on page 81 that is ""quoted"" by John King has been
butchered even more severely:

""<I mention this only to illustrate the> **There is**[these words not
in the original text-prl] lack of agreement even within warring camps
<: things are really in uproar these days, and each of the ""basic"" ways

as there are individual biologists.""

Eldridge goes on:

>Jack

And just a few sentences down:

""When they [creationists] misrepresent the exuberant, creative doubt and
controversy permeating evolutionary biology these days, they are actively
promoting scientific illiteracy.""

And that, John E. King, is precisely what you have done with Eldridge's
article. Are you personally responsible for the butchery of the text or
have you pulled it out of some creationist propaganda? You owe the people
reading t.o an apology for posting such misrepresentation.

I am pleased to announce that a *revised version* of _The Easy-to-Read Book
of Mormon_ (former title: _Mormon's Book_) by Lynn Matthews Anderson is now
available through anonymous ftp (see information below). In addition to the
change in title, the revised ETR BOM has been shortened by several pages
(eliminating many extraneous ""that's"" and ""of's""), and many (minor) errors
have been corrected. This release includes a simplified Joseph Smith Story,
testimonies of the three and eight witnesses, and a ""Words-to-Know""
glossary.

As with the previous announcement, readers are reminded that this is a
not-for-profit endeavor. This is a copyrighted work, but people are welcome
to make *verbatim* copies for personal use. People can recuperate the
actual costs of printing (paper, copy center charges), but may not charge
anything for their time in making copies, or in any way realize a profit
from the use of this book. See the permissions notice in the book itself
for the precise terms.

Negotiations are currently underway with a Mormon publisher vis-a-vis the
printing and distribution of bound books. (Sorry, I'm out of the wire-bound
""first editions."") I will make another announcement about the availability
of printed copies once everything has been worked out.

FTP information: connect via anonymous ftp to carnot.itc.cmu.edu, then ""cd
pub"" (you won't see anything at all until you do).

""The Easy-to-Read Book of Mormon"" is currently available in postscript and
RTF (rich text format). (ASCII, LaTeX, and other versions can be made
available; contact dba@andrew.cmu.edu for details.) You should be able to
print the postscript file on any postscript printer (such as an Apple
Laserwriter); let dba know if you have any difficulties. (The postscript in
the last release had problems on some printers; this time it should work
better.) RTF is a standard document interchange format that can be read in
by a number of word processors, including Microsoft Word for both the
Macintosh and Windows. If you don't have a postscript printer, you may be
able to use the RTF file to print out a copy of the book.

  i don't consider myself an unthinking sheep.  the bible says god created
us to be in communion and obedience to him.  the first and only rule was
to not eat of a certain tree, or else the punishment is distance from him
and physical death.  god's intention in creating us is to have a relationship
with us.  the bible documents god's attempts to have that relationship
culminating in the person of jesus to bear the consequences of all sin so
that all who accept him can have a relationship with god again: the purpose
of creation.

  who is god to impose rules on us?  he's god and he created us.  i suppose
he has a right based on who he is.  above you mention ""In his infinite
wisdom"", and that's what i'd say god exemplifies.  but if you were being
sarcastic up there, then this whole discussion is irrelevant, eh?  and if
we believe god is infinitely wise, that belief should inform our relationship
with him.

  just a point, i suppose, if open mind means believing anything can be true
or we can't for sure know what is definitely true, i'm happy to not be open
minded.  if, however, open mindedness means being respectful and tolerant
towards other beliefs, respecting the rights and intelligence and wisdom

try my very best to be open minded.  just a thot in passing.... :)

  not being married, i cannot say too much to you, but from my perspective
having mutually exclusive faiths would be a big enough roadblock for me in
considering marrying someone.  making it much bigger than it is?  i suppose
that depends on how serious each of you is in your beliefs.  lukewarm atheists
and christians for whom religion is of nominal importance probly would feel
the issue isn't very big.  i suppose the more important your beliefs are to
each of you, the more important the issue is.

That you don't recognize the Biblical commentary used.  Those in the

You missed the point -- which is that the Prophets, the Psalms, and

event -- a wedding.

How are you able to make such a conclusion?  Please note, that the
first part of Revelation makes it clear that the address is to those
in the church. That said, it doesn't hurt to try to see what the 
prophecies are ahead of time -- for those outside the church.

Very glad you asked, since I goofed -- it should be Philippian 1:14-19: 
(here from NIV)

	Because of my chains, most of the brothers in the Lord
	have been encouraged to speak the word of God more
	courageously and fearlessly.

	It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and 
	rivalry, but others out of good will. The latter do so
	in love, knowing that I am put here for the gospel. 
	The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not
	sincerely, supposing that they can stir up trouble for
	me while I am chains. But what does it matter? 

	The important thing is that in every way, whether from
	false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because
	of this I rejoice.
	
My comment stems from the realization that we who love the Lord, are
human and imperfect. Whatever we ""preach,"" no matter how eloquent, or
how corrupted -- is of little difference. Those who know the Master's
voice will recognize Him -- a gem-stone amidst rock. Such is also the 
lesson of the ""stumblingblock."" For those who have an ear to hear.

Never lived out in the country I see. 4 years ago I had a place
where I had to carry in propane every month, hook the bottle up 
to copper line, to supply both the stove, and a type of water-
heater called a flash-heater. A flash heater has a pilot lamp.

Here's the point. If the Davidians had their propane tanks hooked 
up to copper (or some such) lines, run through the ceiling spaces
-- when the FBI started wrecking the place, they could easily have
ruptured the lines. Which then would start spreading out through
the overhead. And since it was a country home, it wasn't necessarily
built with non-flamable insulation. 

It's probably more plausible than anything else, that the fire started
mainly as a result of accident -- or willful negligence on the part of
the FBI, which should have known better (ie. manslaughter).

It's certain that if the tanks hadn't been used that day -- the fire
wouldn't have started.

No, this is far from clear.  We only have the word of the FBI spokepeople that
a survivor made this claim.  We have the contradictory word of the lawyers who
spoke with the survivors individually that ALL of them agreed that they did
NOT have a suicide pact and did not intentionally start the fire.  In the absense
of any more evidence, I don't see how we can decide who to believe.
Furthermore, its quite possible that there was no general suicide pact and that
some small inner circle took it upon themselves to kill everyone else.
With the state of the area now, we may never know what happened.

I will agree on your assessment as to the relative probabilities.  Its more likely
that the BD's started the fire than did the FBI.  But there is currently NO
way to decide what actually happened based on the publically available evidence
(which is nearly none).

   D.   The fire was an started accidentally by the BDs.  I am truely amazed that
        I have heard (or read) of no one suggesting this possibility.
        With all the tear gas and the lack of electical power in the compound and
        the adults wearing gas masks, it had to have been chaotic inside.
        I can easily image someone leaving a lamp too close to something or
        accidentally dropping a lamp or knocking one over.  With the winds, it
        would have quickly gotten out of control.

   No, I think that D is also quite reasonable.  I personally can't really
asses any relative probablities to either of these 3 probabilities although if
forced to bet on the issue, I would probably take an accident (either FBI or
BD) over intential setting of the fire).

   I would also like to add a comment related to the reports that bodies recovered
had gunshot wounds.  The coroner was on the Today Show this morning and categorically
denied that they've reach any such conclusions.  He pointed out that under intense
heat, sufficient pressure builds up in the head that can cause it to explode and
that this can look very much like a massive gunshot wound to the head which is
quite consisted with te reports I've read and heard.

   In short, there's been almost no evidence corroborating any of the many
scenarios as to what happened on Monday.  We should remain skeptical until
more information is available.

  Evolution is both fact and theory.  The THEORY of evolution represents the
scientific attempt to explain the FACT of evolution.  The theory of evolution
does not provide facts; it explains facts.  It can be safely assumed that ALL
scientific theories neither provide nor become facts but rather EXPLAIN facts.
I recommend that you do some appropriate reading in general science.  A good
starting point with regard to evolution for the layman would be ""Evolution as
Fact and Theory"" in ""Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes"" [pp 253-262] by Stephen Jay
Gould.  There is a great deal of other useful information in this publication.

The scientist creates the living creature to examine it, poke and prod it and
learn about its behaviour.  He will kill it if it becomes a threat.  For
example, let's say the scientist creates a Tyrannosaurus Rex and it breaks
free of its confines and starts devouring the population.  The scientist
would not hesitate in killing it.

God creates us to be His loving companions.  He knows whether we are true in 
our love for Him or not.  And He lets us know the consequences of rejecting Him.
God cannot abide by sin.  By rejecting God, a person becomes an enemy of God,
one that must be killed by Him.  Note:  I say that God and God alone is
worthy to be Judge, Jury and Executioner.  We are not called to carry out
such duties because we are not worthy.

Sinning in the face of God was punishable by immediate death.  There are
several OT passages to back this up.  God is God.  He cannot tolerate
the prescence of sin in His midst.  And the Israelites knew this!  And
still, some of them chose to disobey and were destroyed.  Were these
people KIND and LOVing themselves?  God gave them every break He could
but in the end, He really had no choice in the matter.  Seeing as how
we were failing to achieve salvation on our own, He sent His Son to die
for us - to be the ultimate sin offering.  Now we live in the age of
grace.

Hey, let's be fair for a moment here.  KIND and LOVING does not mean
a free ride.  There is an amount of give and take as in any relationship.
Parents are supposed to be kind and loving but does that mean that 
children can do whatever they want?  NOT!  Part of being a parent means
administering punishment when the child is at fault.  Part of being a 
parent means giving instruction.  God tests us through the trial of
life such that we may grow stronger.  He teaches what is right and 
what is wrong.  The consequences of our actions are made clear to us,
be it Heaven or be it Hell.  If God did not follow through with what
He has warned us about, He would not be a very good parent.

In parenting, if a parent issues a warning but does not follow through
with it, the children will not take that parent's words very seriously.
God does the same by telling us who have ears to hear what to do and
what not to do.  By life's trials, we see the folly of doing our own
will rather than His.  He warns us about the consequences of rejecting
Him when it comes time for Judgement.  Do we follow Him?

I will.

Peace be with you,

Malcolm Lee  :)

Nine months, as I understand it.  No doubt this accounts for a 
significant amount of the time as government efficiency in spending
our tax dollars would certainly seek its absolute minimum in such
an event.  But my gut instinct says there is more at hand.  It took
some careful preplanning to demonize D.K. to such an extent.  The
attack meshes well with more restrictive gun control legislation
that seems to be the agenda of the day.  It also fits a pattern of
increased government interference in personal religious beliefs.

I certainly think publication of the warrant undermines the government's
case since it makes no claims of illegal action.  Therefore the federal
judge had reason to seal it.  But I am reminded of Senator Frank Church's
remark that ""secrecy is the trademark of a totalitarian government.""
There is rarely sufficient motive to seal a warrant in a nation of
free people.

How can I argue with irrefutable logic?  I have long suspected that
the government has become a mindless machine and now you go and
confirm my worst fears!  Has it become a BEAST that is programmed
simply to say ""Kiss my toe and you get your piece of the pie?""
I suspect bugs in the program arise when agents or those who love

I had an ehum, interesting experience with the Rosicrucians, or at
least Rosicrucians of some sort last Sunday. They had advertised that
they were holding a lecture titled The Graal of the King -- the room
of the heart (which rhymes in Swedish). Out of curiosity, I went to
the lecture.

There were four people there apart from the two Rosicrucians, one
woman and two men apart from me. The Rosicrucians were male, both of
them. First one of them told us about the Rosicrucians and Lectorium
Rosicrucianum, which was founded in Harlem, NL in 1925. He read
straight from a piece of paper, which I at that point was because he
lacked experience in talking in front of people, but the other guy
read, too, and he was used to holding speeches, I could tell. The
first guy also said that the R:s are a mystical Christian order, and
that they base their teachings on the teachings of the Kathars
(English?) from the thirteenth century.

The other guy took over, reading from his piece of paper in a
fairy-tale teller's voice. What he said sounded like a load of crap to
me. Of course that might be because I am unenlightened or something.
What made me a bit suspicious, was the way they first said that we all
contained something divine, and could find our way back to divinity,
then that we couldn't become divine as the persons we are currently,
but if we worked really hard we would reach eternal bliss. Maybe I've
read too much RAW, but it sounded very much like the things he talks
about in the chapter _How to robotize people and brainwash your
friends_ in _Prometheus rising_. 

It was very interesting to watch the two Rosicrucians. The one holding
the actual lecture, obviously was top dog, and the other one seemed to
be a true believer. I got the impression that the top dog had more
distance to the faith than the true believer, that he used it to gain
power and admiration. He spoke like a fairy-tale teller, whenever he
remembered. ;)

When Robert refers to the ""orthodox"", he is talking about the Historical
position of the Christian Faith. Such things are derived from Biblcal
texts through the centuries by the apocolic fathers of the faith.

You are right that people read things differently in the Bible, and this
is alright in parts like parables and such forth. However, when it comes
to the essential doctrines of the Historical Orthodox Christan Beliefs,
there is only one correct way to read it. For example, either the
doctrine of the Trinity is true, or it is false. Yes, people read the
texts differently, but only one position is true. They both cannot be.
According to the text, the doctrine is true and has always existed.

Therefore, when people like Joseph Smith come along with a vision and
thinks he can undo centuries of a doctrine that is supported by the
Bible, people consider him a cult.

Jesus did not say that he was the fulfillment of the Law, and, unless
I'm mistaken, heaven and earth have not yet passed away. Am I mistaken?
And, even assuming that one can just gloss over that portion of the word
of Jesus, do you really think that ""all is accomplished?""

>Verse 19:  ""Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments,

Then why didn't Jesus say ""Any Jew who annuls ..."" in v. 19? Are you
saying that all of Jesus' recorded words mean nothing to Gentiles? Are
you really saying that Jesus only spoke for and to the Jews? Jesus
didn't mention your name, does that mean he wasn't speaking to you? When
you read the words of Jesus, do you think he is speaking to someone
other than you?

You said above that Jesus was the ""fulfillment"" of the Law. Are you
saying that does not mean ""doing away with the Law""?

>He had come to earth to live the Law as it

Gen3:15(KJV) And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and
between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt
bruise his heel.

Looks like your translation has taken a few liberties with the Word?

Only ""helping the Jewish people?""

                     Welcome to the Peace Run

                     You're invited to join in
                     a Global Relay Run... and
                     help light the Way.



                     ----  Why the Peace Run  ----

There's a new spirit in the Nineties: a spirit of oneness, a growing
belief in the possibility of true global peace.

The goal of the Sri Chinmoy Oneness-Home Peace Run is simple: to
bring this spirit forward in a concrete way, to transform it into
a reality in their own lives.

Every other year, thousands of men, women and children from more
than 70 nations - passing a flaming Peace Torch from hand to hand -
join together in a relay run that virtually circles the globe.
Transcending political and cultural boundaries, they go from
nation to nation - across mountains, jungles and deserts - carrying
the message of brotherhood to all humankind.

Each person who holds or runs with the Peace Torch lights a path
for those who follow. Each time the Peace Torch changes hands, the
flame of oneness burns a little brighter - until one day it will
shine in the hearts and minds of every individual on earth.


		    ----  Making History  ----

The three Peace Runs since 1987 have achieved some historic break-
throughs: in the Middle East, a landmark run crossed the Egyptian-
Israeli border; in Europe, a precedent-setting run linked Eastern
and Western Europe with Russia; in the United States, Mexico and
Canada, entire cities were dedicated to the cause of world peace;
and in Poland, the Peace Torch was blessed by Pope John Paul II.


		 ----  Speaking as One: World  ----
             ----  Leaders, Celebrities - and You  ----

The Peace Run has won the support of leaders the world over -
Presidents, Prime Ministers, religious leaders, sports figures and
entertainment personalities.

Its message has spread to a half billion people though newspaper
reports, magazine articles and radio and TV broadcasts, including
specials on PBS, MTV and NBC's Today Show.

> ""I am happy to support your Peace Run for justice, peace and
reconciliation. The world must know that God wants us to live
amicably as brothers and sisters, members of one family, the human
family, God's family.""  - Archbishop Desmond Tutu,
			  Nobel Peace Prize Winner


		   ----  How It All Works  ----

Peace Run 1993 started with a five-borrough relay in New York
City on Saturday April 17, converging at various points to lead
up to the opening ceremony outside the United Nations Dag
Hammarskjold Building. There, runners from around the world
were gathered for the fourth lighting of the Peace Torch.

From there, Peace Torches are now being transported to over
seventy countries for a series of concurrent international or
cross-country relay runs including the United States, Canada,
Japan, Australia, Russia and Eastern and Western Europe. Smaller
runs will take place in the Philippines, Mexico, Israel, South
America, Egypt and elsewhere in Africa. Distance to be covered:
31,000 miles.

>""The Peace Run wil do much to inspire the hearts and stimulate
the minds of those who support, participate in, witness, or hear
about the event.""  - Carl Lewis,
                     Six-Time Olympic Gold Medalist


                  ----  Who's Behind It  ----

The Peace Run is sponsored by the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team, an
international running organization that believes sports can be a
powerful instrument for promoting world peace. Each year the Team
puts on hundreds of athletic events, including several world-class
ultramarathons, marathons and triathlons, in dozens of countries.

The Peace Run itself is inspired by the global peace ambassador
Sri Chinmoy, who has written and lectured extensively on peace,
offered hundreds of free peace concerts and met with countless
world figures to advance the cause of international harmony.

The Run is managed by Peace Runs International, a non-profit
organization based in the United States.


               ----  Take a Step For Peace  ----

The Peace Runs in 1987, 1989 and 1991 attracted nearly half a
million participants. We're expecting even more people to join
Peace Run '93.

You can also join the Run - carrying the Peace Torch a few steps,
a few blocks or a few miles. Or you can come out and cheer the
runners as they carry the Torch through your community.

You can also join local celebrities and government officials in
one of the thousands of welcoming ceremonies scheduled along the
70-nation route.

Your inner support is important too. If you're a runner, each time
you go out, you can dedicate your run to the cause of world peace.

Sorry if this is late for the thread, but...

I thought God was supposed to be constant and never-changing.  How do
you reconcile this common Christian view with the paragraph above?

Also, while we're at it:

1. How do you reconcile ""A KIND and LOVING God!!"" with the
Judeo-Christian view that sin was at one time ""immediately punishable
by death""?  Was killing people for sinning God's way of showing
KINDness and LOVE?

2. Is the fact the He no longer does this an admission on His part of
having made a mistake?

3. Now that we are ""living in the age of grace"", does this mean that
for our sins, God now damns us to eternal hell after we die, rather
than killing us immediately?  If so, is this eternal damnation an
example of ""A KIND and LOVING God!!""?

Just curious.

Then delete the ""unfortunately"".   Now tell me that the two statement
say effectively the same thing.

And to save everyone a couple of trips round this loop, please notice
that we are only obliged to use force to preserve self.   We can choose
*not* to preserve self, which is the point of pacifism.

Hmm, it seems that this is the core of Christianity then, you 
have to feel guilty, and then there's this single personality
that will save you from this universal guilt feeling.

Brian, I will tell you a secret, I don't feel guilty at all,
I do mistakes, and I regret them, however I've never had this
huge guilt feeling hanging over my shoulder.

If things happen wrong, I will try to learn from the mistakes
and go on.

This all is a very clear indication that you need a certain
personality type in order to believe and adjust to certain
religious doctrines. And if your personality type is 
opposite, then you are not that easily attached to a certain
world view system.

All I know is that I don't know everything. And frankly speaking
I don't care, life is fun anyway. I recognize that I'm not 
perfect, but that does not hinder me from have a healthy
and inspiring life.

There are humans that subscribe to the same notion. The nice
thing is that when you finally shake off this huge burden,
the shoulders feel far more relaxed!

The problem is that you imagine him inside this huge wall, unable
to see reality. While he imagines the same about you. Clearly we
have a case where relativity plays a big role concerning looking
at opposite frames of reality.

It seems faith is the only tool available for emotional purposes
due to the tragedy. As such it maybe fills a need, however I'm
getting tired to see children dying in pain in Sudan due to lack
of food, and assuming that God takes these sufferers to heaven
after a painful death.

Well, this is *only* a guess:  If it goes by the ""true"" meaning of ""bit
map"", then it holds (x,y,c) where x pixel number in th ex-direction, y:
pixel-number in the y-dir, c: colour.

emm386 noems enables the system to use the ""upper memory"" between 640 and

Determine the last dblspace drive required and set that as lastdrive in your
config.sys  If you are using W4WW you might want to go a couple of drives higher
to give you some shared drive space.  Reboot and Novell will set its first
drive one above the lastdrive in config.sys.  You might have to remap some
of your Novell drives if they were originally mapped to lower drives.  Make
sure that the bat file or whatever you are using to log onto Novell is set
to the correct drive (one above the lastdrive setting in the config.sys file).

     I know that I've seen this question asked before, but I don't remember

     Does any one know of an ftp site where the WD90C31 driver might reside?
I've checked cica, and I'm sure it's not there (I'm refering to the new
version of the driver that came out in 2(?)/93).  I have seen it on c-serve,
but I hesitate to d/l 1 meg. at 2400 bps unless I really have to!
     Alternativly, is it possible to get Paradise (or WD) to mail me the new
drivers, or don't they do that.

     Finally, is it even worth the hassle of getting these things, or is
there not much improvement over my 10/92 version?

COM files are limited to a total size of 64KB.  Thus, win.cfn plus vgalogo.log 
plus your RLE file must be less than 64KB.  Thus, your RLE file should be

I would expect the EISA board to be more than twice as fast as the ISA
board.  Not only are you moving data on a path twice as wide (at
least), but there is a difference in the number of clocks required for
bus transactions between the two busses.  Most ISA boards require
multiple clocks per bus transaction -- typically this is around 3-4.
EISA boards are suppose to be able to 'burst' at a 1:1 rate, so I
would expect performance to be 6x-8x that of an ISA card.  

So I guess, for me, the question is unanswered still.  I would expect
him to be able to see a 6x speed difference, and he apparently does
not.

There was a post about something similar a while back.  It seems windows
does *not* take it upon itself to free up any sys. resources an
applllication is using when that application is done.  That job is left
entirely to the application.  that is, the application has to clean up
after itself when it quits.

Anyone out there know if there is a utility for windows which  will
clean up sys. resources when an application quits (mother.zip???).

Here's an interesting table showing how much resources an application
uses and how much it gives back on shut down.  This is take from
Windows User May 1993 issue:


Application		Min. Resource Use	Resource Not Returned
			GDI	USER		GDI	USER

WinSleuth Gold v3.03	10	6		2	14
Word For Windows v2.0b	10	0		5	0
Lotus 123 v1.1		13	3		3	2

Adobe Type Manager v2.5	1	0		NA	NA
Skylight v2.0		1	0		0	0

*The numbers are in percentage and are in a decreasing order.

What does this table tells you, if you frequently start and exit a
program that doesn't give back all of it's resources, then you
continually lose these resouces.  Therefore, only open these programs
up once and leave them open.


BTW:  Maybe people can add to this list so we know what application to
watch out for.

Actually, you might be surprised to find that not everyone who develops
mainstream DOS and Windows apps develops them under DOS or Windows.  PC
Week recently printed a rumor that Microsoft's Excel development group
does its development under OS/2.  Another trade rag did an article
recently about a group doing Windows development on Sun SPARCstations
with SoftPC to test out their work.  SCO Unix is and has been a
reasonably popular development platform for DOS, Windows, and even OS/2
apps.  DOS and Windows are simply not robust or stable enough for
development work, IMHO, and apparently others agree.

It does sound funny, I will admit.  But for me it is true.  Windows crashed on
all of the time (and from what I have read in PC Mag, this is not the exception)
.  OS/2 gives each windows app a VDM and they can't touch each other or
(generally) anything they aren't supposed to have.  If windows works for you,
then great.  Maybe this is why some people don't see why OS/2 is the OS of 
choice.  If windows doesn't crash on you, and you don't mind waiting on each
task, and not being able to adress your memory better than DOS, some of the
key reasons for using OS/2 are gone.  I probably  would still use it, but it
would be more of an even fight.

    OVERVIEW

    The DIB image file format is intended to be a ""Device Independent  Bitmap""
    file  format.  (What Microsoft means by ""Device Independent"" is unclear to
    me.) Four pixel resolutions are supported: 1 bit, 4 bit, 8 bit, and 24 bit
    pixels.

    These images were intended for use on DOS (IBM, or Little-Endian) systems.
    If	you  are  creating them on another architecture you will have to byte-
    swap all short and long integer values.

    By convention, DIB images end in the extension "".BMP"".   This  is  because

    they  are  a  super-set of earlier ""bitmap image files"".  Consequently you
    will sometimes hear DIB files referred to as ""BMP"" files.

    Since DIB images files are a super-set, there are three ""flavors""  of  DIB
    images:
	 o   DOS DIB images.  These are the recommended	 convention,  and  the
	     form  which I will describe how to create.	 They are intended for
	     applications running under MS Windows /3.0 in a DOS environment.
	 o   OS/2 DIB images.  My understanding is that these are  the	flavor
	     of DIB images that were used by the Presentation Manager.
	 o   Old-style Bitmap images.

    DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FLAVORS

    The DOS DIB images consist of:
	 1.  A ""BITMAPFILEHEADER"" file header which identifies the file	 as  a
	     DIB  file.	  This	header	also gives the total size of the image
	     file, and the offset to the image data.
	 2.  A ""BITMAPINFOHEADER""  image  header  which	 specifies  the	 image
	     attributes.
	 3.  An optional palette of colors used by the image.  If  it  exists,
	     this  may contain 2, 16, or 256 entries.  Each entry is a Windows
	     RGBQUAD structure.
	 4.  The image data itself.


    The OS/2 DIB images consist of:
	 1.  The same ""BITMAPFILEHEADER"" file header which identifies the file
	     as	 a  DIB	 file.	 This  header also gives the total size of the
	     image file, and the offset to the image data.
	 2.  A ""BITMAPCOREHEADER""  image  header  which	 specifies  the	 image
	     attributes.
	 3.  An optional palette of colors used by the image.  Again, if  this
	     exists  it	 may  contain  2, 16, or 256 entries.  Each entry is a
	     Windows RGBTRIPLE structure.
	 4.  The image data itself.


    The Old Style image bitmap consists of:
	 1.  Either a BITMAPINFOHEADER or a  BITMAPCOREHEADER.	 Which	header
	     type is determined by the first long integer (DWORD) value.
	 2.  An optional color palette.	  This	palette	 may  be  composed  of
	     either   Windows	RGBQUAD	  structures  (if  the	header	was  a
	     BITMAPINFOHEADER) or Windows RGBTRIPLE structures (if the	header
	     was a BITMAPCOREHEADER).
	 3.  The image data itself.


    CREATING DIB IMAGE FILES.

    Creating a DOS DIB image file consists of several straight forward	steps.
    The headers need to be created and then written to the file.  These header
    structures are defined in the MS  Windows/3.0  ""windows.h""	include	 file.
    Palette  information  needs	 to  be	 stored for images that are not 24-bit
    images.  The five general steps are:
	 1.  Filling  in  the  BITMAPFILEHEADER	  and	the   BITMAPINFOHEADER
	     structures the basic image information.
	 2.  If the image is a 1-bit, 4-bit, or an 8-bit image,	 creating  the
	     color palette of RGBQUADS.
	 3.  Calculating the total file size and putting this  information  in

    THE BITMAPFILEHEADER

    This structure is defined in ""windows.h"" as:
	 typedef struct tagBITMAPFILEHEADER {
		 WORD	 bfType;
		 DWORD	 bfSize;
		 WORD	 bfReserved1;
		 WORD	 bfReserved2;
		 DWORD	 bfOffBits;
	 } BITMAPFILEHEADER;

    The ""bfType"" field is the two ascii characters 'B' and 'M'.	  This	serves
    to	identify  the  file  as	 a  DIB	 image file.  On an intel byte ordered
    machine (IBM or a compatible), this constant can be formed	in  C  as  the
    quantity ('M' << 8 | 'B') == 0x4d42 on an intel system.

    The ""bfSize"" field is the total size of the file.  For our	purposes  this
    field  is equal to: the size of the BITMAPFILEHEADER, plus the size of the
    BITMAPINFOHEADER, plus the number of entries in the	 color	palette	 times
    the	 size  of  a  RGBQUAD, plus the number of bytes of image data.	If the
    image data is being written out in an uncompressed form, this value can be
    calculated	ahead  of  time.   Otherwise, this field needs to be filled in
    later.

    Both the ""bfReserved1"" and the ""bfReserved2""  fields  are  always  set  to
    zero.

    The ""bfOffBits"" field is set to the offset to the start of the image  data
    from  the  start  of the file.  For our purposes, this field should be set
    to:	 the  size  of	the   BITMAPFILEHEADER,	  plus	 the   size   of   the
    BITMAPINFOHEADER,  plus  the  number of entries in the color palette times
    the size of a RGBQUAD.  This works out because the image data  is  written
    write after the color palette if one exists.


















			      March 15, 1991





				    - 6 -


    THE BITMAPINFOHEADER

    This structure is defined in ""windows.h"" as:
	 typedef struct tagBITMAPINFOHEADER{
		 DWORD	 biSize;
		 DWORD	 biWidth;
		 DWORD	 biHeight;
		 WORD	 biPlanes;
		 WORD	 biBitCount;
		 DWORD	 biCompression;
		 DWORD	 biSizeImage;
		 DWORD	 biXPelsPerMeter;
		 DWORD	 biYPelsPerMeter;
		 DWORD	 biClrUsed;
		 DWORD	 biClrImportant;
	 } BITMAPINFOHEADER;

    The ""biSize"" field is set to the size of  the  BITMAPINFOHEADER  structure
    itself.   When  reading  the  image	 file,	this  value is what is used to
    determine  that  the  image	 contains  a  BITMAPINFOHEADER	 and   not   a
    BITMAPCOREHEADER.

    The ""biWidth"" field is the width of the image in image pixels.

    The ""biHeight"" field is the height of the image in image lines.

    The ""biPlanes"" field should always be set to 1.  This data is written  out
    as if there was one color plane.

    The ""biBitCount"" field is the bit-depth of the image.  This must be either
    1, 4, 8, or 24, depending on the bit-depth of the image data.

    The ""biCompression"" field tells how the image data is compressed if it  is
    compressed.	   DIB	images	support	 two  forms  of	 run-length  encoding.
    However, I have never seen any images which use it, and don't know yet how
    it works.  Set this field to zero (long zero, or 0L), to indicate that the
    data is not compressed.

    All subsequent fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER  structure  may  be  set  to
    zero.   A  requirement  of	the  interpretting software that it be able to
    compute these fields as necessary from the previous information.

    The field which you might want to explicitly specify might be ""biClrUsed"".
    For	 4-bit	and  8-bit  images  this  field	 indicates that not all of the
    possible color entries are used and that the  image	 contains  ""biClrUsed""
    colors.  If you are using only 32 colors with an 8-bit image, then you may
    only want to save 32 of the possible 256 palette entries.  Generally,  set
    this field to zero.



			      March 15, 1991





				    - 7 -


    COLOR PALETTES

    Each entry of a  color  palette  is	 a  RGBQUAD  structure.	  The  RGBQUAD
    structure is defined in the ""windows.h"" include file as:
	 typedef struct tagRGBQUAD {
		 BYTE	 rgbBlue;
		 BYTE	 rgbGreen;
		 BYTE	 rgbRed;
		 BYTE	 rgbReserved;
	 } RGBQUAD;
    The ""rgbReserved"" field is always zero.  For each color used,  the	amount
    of Blue, Green, and Red are filled into the structure and the structure is
    written to the file.  A value of zero in  the  ""rgbBlue"",  ""rgbGreen"",  or
    ""rgbRed""   fields  indicates  that	that  particular  component  does  not
    contribute to the color composition.  A value  of  255  in	any  of	 these
    fields  indicates  that  the  component  contributes  fully	 to  the color
    composition.



    IMAGE DATA

    There are three surprises about the ordering of image data	in  DIB	 image
    file.   The	 creator  of  this  format  was determined to be creative, and
    certainly was.

    Within the image data, each line written out is padded to  the  next  four
    byte  quantity.   So,  if  you had an 8-bit image which was only one pixel
    wide, you still have to write out four bytes for every  image  line.   The
    number of bytes per line can be calculated as:

		 bytes_per_line = (width_in_pix * bit_depth + 31 ) / 32 * 4;

	---or, in terms of the fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure---

		 bytes_per_line = (biWidth * biBitCount + 31 ) / 32 * 4;


    When writing out your image data, you must write it out bottom line first.
    The	 bottom line of the image as you would look at it on the screen is the
    first line of image data in the file.

    For 1-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit images, information is written	as  you	 would
    expect.   One  bit	images	are  padded  eight pixels to a byte.  Four bit
    images are padded two pixels to a byte.  Eight bit images are written  one
    pixel per byte.  Twenty-four bit images are written three bytes per pixel.
    However, for 24-bit images the information must  be	 written  out  in  the
    order  blue,  green, red.  While most image file formats write data out in



			      March 15, 1991





				    - 8 -


    an ""RGB"" ordering, a DIB image file	 writes	 the  data  out	 in  an	 ""BGR""
    ordering.

    SUMMARY

    This  should  provide  enough  information	to  create  DIB	 images	  from
    applications  such	as  scanners  or for image exporting routines.	If you
    find out any more about DIB images, please pass the information on	to  me
    so that I can modify this document accordingly.

I  _do_ know  that  IBM systems, the PS/2 56SLC2, in  particular, have
absolutely no  problem  with  OS/2--never had  a ""random"" crash  while
running any of  my programs under  OS/2.   In fact, I  don't  remember
_ever_ crashing.

Of course, I really don't run any  OS/2 programs, just the  same bunch
of DOS and Windows stuff that I've always been running.

And  when  I  had  the  56SLC  (this is  the  386SLC  system)  running
Dos/Windows, I had only  one crash, and it was consistent.   FTP had a
tendency  to  crash  whenever  I would  get  large  files (>1mb)  from
particularly fast  clients  (DTR's  150K-200K/sec), I  figured out the
problem was with smartdrv's write buffering--if I turned off the write
buffer, everything would work fine.

FTP under OS/2 has never locked,  though.  I can even format  floppies
(to use the most often cited example of the superiority of OS/2.)

Yeah, I guess I'm willing to admit that OS/2  is somewhat sensitive to
specific hardware.  WP51 for DOS works perfectly fine on my SLC2...

Well,  I save all  my  personal files to floppy,  and when  i did that
under Windows, a floppy save of a large file hung up the system.

I  also found  it quite bothersome to  have  to  continually tweak the
tasking options  on fractint for dos whenever I wanted to do a fractal
computation in the background.

>> and not being able to address your memory better than DOS,

>	Not sure what you mean here.

The idea is  that OS/2's DOS sessions can see more memory than Windows
DOS  sessions.  I  let  XPL (a  shareware calculus program) see around
720KB of free _conventional_ memory, which lets me  do bigger symbolic
manipulations than is possible  under straight DOS (where it would see
around 610KB of conventional RAM.).  I  also found it really handy for
my _own_ DOS-based programs, which, without  any re-writing, could now
handle larger data sets, simulate for more iterations, etc. Of course,
the  point is  now moot,  since  the OS/2 programs I now write  simply
_never_ run into memory limitations.  I never programmed  for Windows,
so I don't have much of a comparison here, though....

Keywords: coda finale music font atm petrucci eps adobe
Organization: Gallagher & Robertson A/S
Lines: 36


I've been using Final from CODA for some time, but suddenly it stopped using 
my fonts. I have a 386 PC with lots of disk space and memory, a Postscript 
laser, Win3.1, Finale 2.0.1 and I recently installed ATM 2.0. I've been 
fiddling around with the Windows setup for some time, and when I needed to do 
some work with Finale things didn't print properly. It might - and it might 
not - have anything to do with the installation of ATM from 1.something to 
2.0, but I don't have the old ATM lying around anomore. 

The most annoying problem was that the Petrucci font didn't print, which is a 
rather important font :-) 

I managed to get direct printing to work if I included OwnPS=0 in the 
[Finale] section of WIN.INI, but Compile PostScript Listing still doesn't 
work; and it's those .EPS files I need. When I look at the .eps files 
generated the only font which appears there is Courier. I found out that if I 
manually changed the Courier 24-point to Petrucci 24-point in the .EPS file 
everything worked ok, but I'd rather avoid that since I have a lot of songs 
to work with. 

And yes, in the Special/Font/Font names dialog box all the fonts I need are 
listed, with the correct mapping between Finale, Screen and Printer fonts. 
Finale is obviously aware of the fonts since direct printing of a score works 
well (that is, after I included OwnPS=0), and all my other Windows 
applications print Petrucci and the other fonts well. 

Has anyone encountered problems like this? 

What is the current version of Finale from Coda Music Software? I have 2.0.1

Are the people at Coda available on Internet or X.400?

I'd be grateful for all hints and help.                                -mats

You have one. Minimize the print manager and drag a file to it and it will
print it. You need to associate file extensions with such things as the

Subject: WordBasic time/date variables
Summary: Question about time/date vars under wordbasic
Keywords: Winword variable mail wordbasic macro
Organization: The World Public Access UNIX, Brookline, MA
Lines: 32


I'm writing a mail management system using Word for Windows 2.0 as
a front end. The user dials up a remote system and downloads a batch
of mail as ""foo.txt ."" I've set up an AutoExec macro in Winword to load
""foo.txt"" OK, but subsequent invocations of the macro will of course
pose file name contention problems.

What I'd really like to do is to create an AutoExit macro in Winword
that would move ""foo.txt"" to a specified directory, rename it using
the current date and time, and delete the original ""foo.txt .""

In other words, ""foo.txt"" gets renamed as ""5012300"", say, on May 1
at 23:00- the user gets a time-indexed backup of his mail files and
""foo.txt"" is freed up for the next packet of mail, since my AutoExec
macro points to it.

My main question is this: 

How may one rename a file from within a WordBasic macro to include a 
time/date variable in the new filename? 


Thanks-

Basically:
Windows prefers extendend memory instead of expanded (more work to do for Win)
and if no application desperatly needs EMS, you should leave emm386
with a ""REM"" in your config.sys.

I received my Graphite VL on Thursday, and I've had a little bit of 
experience with it now.  In general, it feels *FAST*, although this
is the first VLB card that I have tried.  Still, the results are 
impressive.

With my 486DX2/66 w/16 MB, running at 1024x768/256, I've had the following
WinTach 1.0 results:


Card				WP	CAD	Spread	Paint	Overall
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
ATI Graphics Ultra		13.5	14.5	19.1	25.0	18.0
ATI Ultra+ (no aperture)	11.2	13.8	10.7	20.9	14.1
Hercules Graphite VL		16.1	67.8	41.4	52.8	44.5

Unfortunately I don't have the numbers here, but the ATI Ultra Pro VLB
had an overall WinTach score of about 26.  The Ultra Pro was nearly as
fast in text handling, but was blown away in the CAD and Paint tests.

As an additional test, we hand-timed a complex CorelDraw! slide resize/-
redraw times.  There was no swapping, but I'd expect there is a fairly
heavy load on the CPU.  The Graphite redraw times averaged about 10.2
seconds, with ATI Ultra Pro at 12.0.  This jives with Steve Gibson's
contention that the ISA Graphite is faster than an ATI UP on his complex
Micrografx Draw document.

So far, I'm *very* impressed.  The drivers look solid, and the card flies.
The installation and utilities are different, but comparable to ATI's.  And
I didn't have to wait for Build 59 for some reliability...  With Hercules'
software developer special, you can get an evaluation copy of the card for
just $225 (or $200 for the ISA version).  Call 800-532-0600 if you want to
give it a try -- I'm a happy customer now!

	Yesterday, a friend of mine got a new driver for his card that more
than doubled the speed... Naturally, besides being a tad jealous (same 
machine -- different cards), it got me thinking... What if I am using a slow
driver? Wouldn't that be _horrible_ ? :) So netlanders, I need samples of
your collective experience (sic) -- Do you proud owners of a Trident 8900C
video card w/ 1MB VRAM have tried out more than one driver fro MS Win 3.1
which? which is the fastest? Not to be selfish, and to give you a motive
for responding, I promise I am going to collect all the answers, and the
actual drivers (provided u give me a site to get it from or uuencode&mail)
get the WinMarks using PC Magazine`s WinBENCH and... post the results here...
I am interested in SVGA drivers only (plain VGA users should run the Win
driver, or this is what I 've heard -- dont flame me!) Particularly
800x600x16 and/or 800x600x256 (that should cover the majority of SVGA users)
Well, what are you waiting for? hit that r or f or whatever...
All input welcome -- so are money and Sun SPARCstations...
Thanx in advance...

--> FTP

     COSY_PAK is available by anonymous `ftp' from 
mishna.esys.cwru.edu (Internet No. 129.22.40.23). A sample ftp session 
is given at the end of this file.

**********************************************************************

--> Changes in Version 0.9 (update from v0.81 to v0.9)

	In this version, we have revised COSY_PAK to take advantage of 
the more robust signal processing functions available in Mathematica v2.1.  
Since Mathematica 2.1 provides a better  and  working 
LaplaceTransform and InverseLaplaceTransform functions than 
Mathematica v2.0 did, we adopted them. This has made COSY_PAK 
smaller. Thus Brian Evans' Signal Processing packages that supported 
the LaplaceTransform  and InverseLaplaceTransform functions in the 
COSY_PAK v0.81 are no longer needed directly by COSY_PAK v0.9. For 
power users who  use Signal Processing we still recommend the use of the very  
fine  Brian Evans package on Signal Processing (available at 
the anonymous  ftp site gauss.eedsp.gatech.edu  or  IP # 130.207.226.24).  On  
the  downside, the disadvantage of this update 
can be that Mathematica 2.1 requires more runtime resources than its 
previous version. 


***********************************************************************	
--> For Mathematica 2.0 users
	
	We have included the LaplaceTransform package from Mathematica 2.1 in  
the directory `For_2.0'. Please move all files and directory under For_2.0 into  
the Calculus directory under Mathematica Packages directory. 

**************************************************************************
	    
--> Introduction
   
    This is an unsupported release of COSY_PAK - a COntrol SYstems 
analysis PAcKage for symbolic control systems analysis using 
Mathematica 2.1. Classical control systems analysis and design methods and some  
modern control systems methods have been implemented in this package. 
    
    This package and the attendant notebooks were developed on a 
NeXT (TM) computer (a UNIX based workstation). They have been 
used as a supplementary teaching aid along with  standard control 
engineering texts (Ogata [1991], Phillips and Harbor [1991]) for 
undergraduate courses in `Control Engineering I' taught at the Systems 
Engineering Department of CWRU. In addition to the NeXT, they have 
also been tested successfully on Apple Macintosh computers (TM), and, 
IBM PC's (TM) running MS Windows(TM). We would be very much interested 
to hear from you if you or anybody you know uses this software on 
platforms not mentioned above. IBM users however will have to 
evaluate the notebooks first to visualize the graphics.

    Once installed (see below for instructions), this  collection  of  
Mathematica  packages  can be loaded by any user. Bundled with the 
packages are many notebooks (""COSY_Notes"") which demonstrate  
the functionality of these packages. The notebooks follow a plan of 
many fine, standard, undergraduate Control Engineering text books 
listed in the references. Examples used in these notebooks have 
been collected from the various references given at the end of this 
file. The contents of the notebooks in the ""COSY_Notes"" directory are

--> Compressed Files

        The files that contain  a  complete set of the COSY_PAK v0.9
packages and Notebooks for Mathematica are:

 COSY_PAK_09.tar.Z     		compressed tar file for Unix systems
	
 COSY_PAK_09.sit.hqx     	compressed sit file for Macintosh 
 				systems and encoded by BinHex 4.0 
				format (requires the   shareware
				 Stuffit file v 1.5.1 or higher). 
	
 COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip    	zip file for the IBM PC running MS-DOS
    
     Once expanded the Mathematica files can also be used on 
Macintosh / IBM PC / Unix systems also.


--> Installation of COSY_PAK

 o In UNIX Command line type the following command:

      zcat COSY_PAK_09.tar.Z | tar xvf -

 o In Macintosh open the .sit.hqx file using the shareware
    Stuffit v 1.5.1 or higher.
  
 o In IBM Command line type the following command:

      pkunzip -o -d COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip

NOTE: This .zip file was zipped by zip utility v2.0. You must use 
pkunzip version 2.0 or  higher to unzip it.  IBM PC's may limit the 
directory name characters to eight. In that event type ""pkunzip -o -d 
COSY_PAK.zip.  You can also unzip the COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip file on any 
Unix machine if you have unzip utility on it.


     Uncompressing and untarring ""COSY_PAK_09.tar.Z"" or unzipping 
""COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip"" will create a directory called ""COSY_PAK"".
         	
Once the files are expanded you should see a single directory 
""COSY_PAK"" containing the following three files, four 
sub-directories and their contents:

SUB-DIRECTORIES in ""COSY_PAK"":  
  COSYPAK    - contains control tool box packages 
  MANUAL     - COSY_PAK manual in .ps, .rtf, .txt, and .wn formats. 
  COSY_Notes - contains notebooks 
  For_2.0    - contains Laplace transform package from Mathematica 2.1
  		For Mathematica 2.0 users.	 
    		
FILES in directory ""COSYPAK"":
  chap1.m   chap2.m   chap3.m  chap4.m  chap5.m   chap6.m  chap7.m
	
FILES in directory ""COSY_Notes"":
	01_Introduction.ma	  
	02_Math_Model.ma
	03_1_Transient_Response.ma   
	03_2_Transient_Response.ma   
	03_3_Transient_Response.ma   
	04_Steady_State_Response.ma
	05_Root_Locus.ma	  
	06_Freq_Response.ma 
	07_State_Space.ma         
	
FILES in directory ""For_2.0"":
	LaplaceTransform.m     DiracDelta.m	
	SUB-DIRECTORIES in ""COSY_PAK"":	Common
	FILES in directory ""Common"":  Support.m

********************* Important ********************	

	The notebook example files(.ma files) will be under the 
""COSY_Notes"" directory.  To use the notebooks, move the directory `COSYPAK' to  
a 
directory that  Mathematica can recognize :
	
        /LocalLibrary/Mathematica/Packages     	on a UNIX machine,
        MY_HardDisk:Mathematica:Packages   	on an Apple Macintosh,
        c:\winmath\packages                  	on an IBM PC.

	At the beginning of the ""Initialization"" cell of each notebook 
in  ""COSY_Notes"" directory, we list the example about how to make 
Mathematica identify the directory:

	(* Initialization of Path *)

	(* Example For a UNIX machine  (Default) *) 
	(*
	$Path=Join[$Path,
	{""/LocalLibrary/Mathematica/Packages""}];
	*)
	
	(* Example For an Apple Macintosh  *) 
	(*
	$Path=Join[$Path,
	{""MY_HardDisk:Mathematica:Packages""}];
	*)
	
	(* Example For IBM PC 	
	 *)
	(*
	$Path=Join[$Path,	
	 {""c:\winmath\packages""}];	
	*)	

Change the pathname according to your machine by removing the 
Mathematica comment sign `(*' and `)*' before and after `$Path' 
setting.

	This command makes Mathematica recognize the directory

        /LocalLibrary/Mathematica/Packages     	on a UNIX machine
        MY_HardDisk:Mathematica:Packages   	on a Apple Macintosh
        c:\winmath\packages                	on an IBM PC


--> Mathematica 2.0 users
	
	We include the LaplaceTransform package from Mathematica 2.1 in 
the directory For_2.0. Please move all files and directory under For_2.0 
into the Calculus directory under Mathematica Packages directory. 


--> Getting started

       After installation, start Mathematica and open the notebooks in 
the ""COSY_Notes"" directory. All notebooks load their own packages. 
Navigate in the notebooks and enjoy. IBM users however will have to 
evaluate the notebooks to visualize the graphics.

I've got an old Super VGA card manufactured by SAMPO of Taiwan and I'm
looking for a Windows 3.1 Driver for it.  It's based on the Cirrus Logic
CL-GD510A-32PC-B chip.  I've contacted the suppliers here in New Zealand
and they say that only Windows 2 divers were ever written by the manufacturer.
So if there's a V3.1 driver out for this chip set I'd like to know - 
preferably by e-mail at rjwjames@waikato.ac.nz
                     
Thanks is advance

It's definitely dated - I used OS/2 1.21, & alpha 2.0 (when msft was
developing it...)

I preferred Windows 3.1 because it was more stable & faster than 3.0,
but could still run more apps than OS/2 (again I made this choice
before 2.0 was released).

Hmm. Are you sure?  I'm speaking from my own experience as an
OS/2 _user_. Certainly people in, say, the NT marketing group 
would be in a unique position to present the results of, say,
research on upcoming NT and OS/2 apps (vs Windows and MS-DOS apps).
Part of my point was that just cause one works at microsoft does 
not mean one has access to such data (if it exists).

Again, my point was that not all microsofties are here to ""sell"" 
readers on our products (which would conflict with the ""no-ads"" 
philosophy of usenet).  Nor do we necessarily have access to info
that others have.

I also get tired of people assuming that microsofties are, like,

Subject: SUMMARY:  Canon BJ200 vs. HP DeskJet 500
Organization: Computer Science Department, Stanford University.
Lines: 401


Hello again,

About a week and one-half ago I posted a query looking for people feelings
on the inkjet family of printers.  Specifically, a comparison between the
Canon BJ200 (BubbleJet) and the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500.  Many people
asked me to post the summary/account of all the postings and e-mail I
received.  Below is my original query and the responses I received.  I have
not deleted any part of the responses, only the headers and signatures, so
you can extract what you find necessary.  Some people asked me for an
unbiased account; however, the very nature of the question suggests
favoritism and biased comments, you must extract the information you
believe unbiased and a fair representation of each printer.  There are a
wide range of comments, each has its own value.  

There was no clear winner, some like the BJ200 (especially its
price/performance ratio), others preferred the durability and reliability
of the DeskJet (the original inkjet with proven drivers and a solid
background).  Two new inkjet printers have drawn some attention, a new
printer to be introduced by Hewlett-Packard later this year (around
summertime), and an addition to the Epson product line (their first
inkjet).  You will find that after the initial purchase, the costs of
re-filling or replacing the ink cartridges are about the same (this largely
depends on where you purchase the re-fills or replacements -- so shop
around first since this aspect will most likely dominate the cost of your
printer).  No one mentioned approx. how many sheets each ink cartridge will
print, but I suspect they are roughly equal at about 1000 - 1500 sheets
(laser printers will do 4000-5000 sheets per toner cartridge).  Well,
that's a brief research summary of my personal research.  ENJOY!

Well I bought the BJ 200 about a month ago at the start of their $50 rebate
program on that printer (it ends 5/31), and I bought it from Computer
Discount Warehouse because their price of $325 couldn't be beat anywhere I
looked, and I think it's a HOT printer.  Just using regular copier paper
produced fantastic results just in high quality mode.  I compared the
output of a Micrografx Designer legal size drawing with 4pt type done on my
BJ 200 with the same drawing printed on an HP Laserjet IID and I was amazed
how well I could read the small print on the BJ 200.  Printing speed was
several seconds faster on the BJ 200 which is amazing considering that the
HP has 2.5M ram installed.  I measured the time from when the printer first
indicated it was receiving data (as I used print manager in Windows).

I showed the output to several people at work and one manager bought one
immediately for his office, and two other engineers placed their orders
too.  If you need CDW's phone number, it's 800-598-4239.  Delivery to NY
was two days.

Good luck!

===========================================================================

I own a Deskjet 500. Performance isn't spectacular under Windows using
TrueType fonts but neither is the Canon from what I have seen. Quality for
the HP is very much dependent on paper quality - on 'standard' photo-copy
paper the characters have slightly 'frayed' edges but on better quality
'distinction' type paper things look better. For most applications I find
copy paper fine - still better than dot-matrix.  Comes with a Windows
driver, which seems to by-pass print manager, has a few
'intelli-fonts'which are HP scaleable fonts - probably faster than TrueType
but haven't really tried them out. Can get RAM & FONT cartridges but unless
the speed of TrueType is a problem I wouldn't bother. The RAM cartridges
can't be used as buffer - soft fonts only.

For graphics, i.e. BMP images etc the HP can be put into a dither mode via
the HP supplied Win driver. There a number of dither options such as
'scatter', 'pattern' etc.  The manual gives recommendations depending on
the type of image being printed.  Text is not so good in this mode. Problem
arises when you have a document which contains both graphic and text.  The
range of tones for graphic images isn't brilliant but I think that is more
of a limitation with inkjet printers in general.

>From what I have seen the Canon is similar in most respects.

However, a printer definitely worth looking at is the new inkjet from
Epson.  This printer is faster, cheaper, and capable of producing
laser-like quality on normal copier paper.  Can't remember the model #, LX
- something I think?

I purchased my HP days before the Epson was released here :-{.  The
introductory price on the Epson was the same as the HP here in New Zealand.
 
===========================================================================

About a month ago, I got a Canon BJ200.  I absolutely LOVE it.  It is
incredibly fast, except for printing from PSPICE (I don't know if you ever
do stuff with that or not.)  Most of the stuff I print is either from
Microsoft Word for Windows or just plain text.  The only problems I've had
are printing headers/footers (the printer freaked out), and printing on
cheap paper (lots of streaks).  Normal copy paper works great with it, you
can only tell it's not laser-printed by holding it, oh, less than twelve
inches from your face.  (That is, if you're nearsighted, like me! :) ) The
printer comes with its own driver for Windows 3.1!!  I have no other
complaints.  The printer also can act just like some EPSON or another for
those archaic software packages that haven't written a driver for it yet.
The teeny-weeny footprint is a real plus, too--AND, if you purchase it
between now and May 31, you get a $50 rebate from Canon!!  I bought mine
from a store called CompUSA, and the price now is $340.  I have a friend
who has the HP you are looking at.  It also prints very well, and everyone
has drivers for it, BUT it is VERY slow!

Hope I helped!

(360dpi sure looks great!)

  I guess I have some experience with both: I have a BJ-300 at work and a
Deskjet 500 at home.  I prefer the Deskjet.  The printing speed and quality
are similar (I tested both with text and graphics before buying the Deskjet
for home).  The feature that sets the Deskjet apart is the driver support
in so many applications.  The BJ ends up emulating the Epson LQ or IBM
Proprinter to get it to work with many non-windows apps and this will be
the case for a long time.  The design is superior if you just want to use
cut paper, the Deskjet is quieter, AND the ink cartridges are quite a bit
cheaper due to the number of Deskjets out there in comparision to the BJs.

  Just my $0.02 worth..

===========================================================================

  Yes, there is the landscape mode printing problem, but it does not
present a problem in Windows as the Windows printer driver handles the
translation.  I actually thought of some other points after I posted the
note.  The Deskjet has an unprintable area of approximately .5inch around
the paper the Bubblejet does not.  You are right about the graphics
resolutions, I tested the printers with the applications I had access to:
Wordperfect, Harvard Graphics, WinGIF, Paintshop PRO, and Paintbrush and
could not tell a difference.  In fact one of the HP Deskjet Windows drivers
gives you significant control over the contrast and density of the printer
hence controlling the amount of ink you put down.  The Bubblejet did not.
I had no imaging software to test the printers with and so had no
comparision there.  Finally, I wanted sheet feeding.  In that configuration
the Bubblejet cost approximately $100 more than the Deskjet.

I went through a pretty thorough evaluation and chose the Deskjet when I
spent my own money.  BTW, I am replacing the BJ-300 with a Deskjet 500 at
work this month anyway.

===========================================================================

I spent some time comparing the two.  We ended up getting the Bubblejet
BJ-200 versus the HP.  Our reasons were:

1) The HP seemed to have worse banding than the Canon
2) 360dpi versus 300 - we felt we could see the difference
3) Price - Canon has a $50 rebate program going on at the moment.

The BJ-200 was our choice over the BJ-10ex - we could have 100 pages in the
BJ-200 feeder.  The BJ-10ex holds only 30 pages, I think.

As you can see, up to 100 pages on the BJ-200.  We haven't done anything
big with the BJ, but its performance seems reasonable under Windows.  I
know that the Microsoft BBS has a newer windows driver than comes with the
printer, but I don't know how it compares (also the driver included with
the printer is Canon's whereas I don't know where the Microsoft BBS one
comes from - Microsoft?)

Hope this helps.

Altough I'm sometimes also a salesperson (if I'm not suppost to study :-))
I would recommend to buy the BJ200. The printing quality is a bit better,
but you you've got much more possiblities. Don't forget the HP engine is at
least 2 years on the marked, the Canon engine (witch is also used in
other ""new"" bubblejet printers like e.g. the Epson ones) is quite recently
available..

I've seen during a short demonstration (from someone who tryed to sell me
Canon printers) 2 times the same picture, one printed with the BJ200, one
with the Canon, the other with the HP, and.. there was a difference in
printing- quality,.. The Canon was a bit better..

===========================================================================

When we decided we needed quiet printers in our hospital we looked to
inkjet printers.  They have near laser quality, speed, and they are quiet.
We use both HP Deskjets and the Canon BJ-200s.  I prefer the paper handling
qualities of the Deskjets but I feel the Canons have superior print
quality.  The Ideal would be a Canon with a sheet feeder, however I did end
up buying a deskjet for home use (got too good a deal).  Anyway, we are
using Canons in high volume areas and they are holding up very well.  Out
of 15 Deskjets and 4 BJ-200s I have only had one problem with a deskjet and
that was taken care of very quickly by HP.

===========================================================================

Whenever I buy anything I look at what the ""experts"" say, pick out the top
few and then buy on whatever criteria are the most apt.  I've been
unusually flush lately (no begging letter please) and so I've done this a
few times including - about four months ago - with inkjet printers.

I can't remember much about the process except that I read about three
reviews of inkjets and that the 500 was always at or near the top.  I
bought the 500C because of the added dimension of colour (I intend to build
a multi- media machine at some stage and have just bought a colour scanner
towards that).  Although I haven's used the colour thing in earnest yet I
tried it out on a couple of Windows bitmaps and I was pleased with the
result.

I note that even though you can now get the 550C (the one with both colour
and mono with no need to change the cartridge), the 500C and 500 are still
readily available (at least in the UK).  The following are my
views/experience:

	1.	I don't know anything about the Canon except that I came away
		from reviews (and replies to a posting similar to yours) with
		the idea that the HP offered the best performance/price ratio.

	2.	I believe HP are the originals in the field - not always the
		ideal place to be but the market's still young so one assumes
		they have the expertise.

	3.	The 500C is worth the extra.  Operation in mono is perfectly
		acceptable and I get good crisp reproduction of fonts from
		Windows.

	4.	I used to work for Monotype when they still manufactured
		typesetters (before their AMERICAN owners closed them down!)
		and I can tell you that in terms of definition 300 dpi is
		pretty poor anyway so 360 dpi is just a bit less poor...

	5.	The HP comes with a reasonable set of drivers.

	6.	If you buy it invest in the additional RAM pack - it's pretty

===========================================================================

Just bought the BJ-200.  I thought the price couldn't be beat ($329, with
$50 rebate thru 5/31) and so far it is comparable, even superior, to the
DeskJet in print quality.

Speed:   Per page rate seems to be faster (I don't have figures).
         I don't print long docs, though.

Quality: I think the graphics quality is excellent.  Print quality is
         excellent as well, unless you use small fonts and hold it up
         close; you can see a lot more ""jaggies"" than on a LaserJet.
         The 360 dpi is offset by a little less accuracy in holding the
         page/print head in place, I would imagine.

Large docs:  Not room in the standard model for a whole lotta pages ...
         manual says up to 100, though.  Haven't tried it.

Drivers:  No problems under Win3.1 yet.  WinWord doesn't want to print
         the envelopes the same way the Canon does, though.

Know nothing of add-on costs.

I just bought a BJ-200 printer a couple of days ago.  I compared it to the
sample print of an HP DeskJet 500 and knew that the HP wasn't for me.  The
BJ-200 is pretty fast and really prints with good quality.  I can compare
it with the HP LaserJet IIID PostScript and they look almost identical (
depending on the kind of paper).  I don't have problems with the ink not
being dry, it seems to dry VERY fast.  Probably within a second.  Since
Canon is giving a $50 rebate until the end of May, it is really a good buy.

Wow, it's funny you should ask this.  I'm a little behind in news reading
so I know this may be late.

  I just purchased the Canon Bubblejet last night.  I was really worried
that I wouldn't like it but the print quality, and noise level is
fantastic!  I printed quite a few documents with lots of graphics and it
printed DAMN near laser quality.  You can't tell it's not laser unless you
get 2 inches from the page.

  no problems with drivers.  The printer came with the driver diskette
which is good because I was beginning to panic when I couldn't findi it
under Windows or WordPerfect.  It works well under both.  I have yet to
install Word for Windows so don't know how it works with them.

  I had a DeskJet 500 at work last year.  It was a good printer as well ut
I felt it was awfully slow.  And much noisier than the BubbleJet.  I won't
say the BubbleJet is MUCH better, but I really do like it more.  Just my
$0.02 worth.

Hello All!

    It is my understanding that all True-Type fonts in Windows are loaded in
prior to starting Windows - this makes getting into Windows quite slow if you
have hundreds of them as I do.  First off, am I correct in this thinking -
secondly, if that is the case - can you get Windows to ignore them on boot and
maybe make something like a PIF file to load them only when you enter the
applications that need fonts?  Any ideas?

Are you sure you want to do that?  If a win app locks up for some reason, 
ctrl-alt-del may be the only way to kill the app and get back to Windows.  
Granted it doesn't work all that often but it has come in handy on occasion.
I consider it pretty carefully before I disabled that keystroke.  Just a

I think it is important to clear up your first reply.  You gave the
impression that you should not use smartdrive with stacker.   You are
correct re: caching the compressed drive.  However, as I understand it,
you can cache the uncompressed drive.  Thus if you have compressed your
disk C:, you will have a C and probably a D drive under stacker.  C being
the compressed disk (which is just a large file on D:) and D being the
uncompressed disk.  You should only attempt to stack D:.  In fact, with
Win 3.1 and smartdrv.exe, it seems smart enough to automatically default
to stacking your A,B and D drives.

This is the part that usually gets me. While I am set to make money, there usually
are OTHER things to be considered and debated. That is the purpose of life.
If you only willing to look at the stock price and sales numbers for gratification,
usually you'll end up with Japanese (or whoever that is competitive) owing your

selfish. Henceforth, ignoring the attack is not the right approach. As a matter of

greatest assets of this society. Sales number and stock price is the short-term

If you happen to be running the new msdos 6, you could use multi-

I have been using the JOIN command for many years now, mostly with good
success in duplicating unix-style file mounts.  You will hear lots of
people cursing JOIN because they confuse it with the dos APPEND command
(a truely gnarly hack), but don't believe them.  You also will hear
people saying that Microsoft recommends that you not use JOIN.  But, in
Microsoft's Windows 4 Workgroups Resource toolkit, the following appears:

  ""JOIN, an MS-DOS utility, works fine with Windows for Workgroups 3.1 if
  you do not change the state of the joined drives during a Windows for
  Workgroups 3.1 session. This includes adding or removing joined drives
  from within Windows for Workgroups. We recommend that you do not use
  JOIN when running Windows Setup or Windows for Workgroups 3.1.""

Within this caveat, JOIN appears to be valid under windows.  However, I
have found a couple of applications that don't deal well with filesystems
that have been ""mounted"" using join.

In particular, the worst offender is Word for Windows 2.0x.  It gets very
confused when you edit and then try to save a file on a joined drive. It
wants to create the saved file as ~NNNNN.tmp in the current dir, then
delete the old file and rename the ~NNNNN.tmp file to the *.doc file.

Unfortunately, WfW usually writes the ~NNNNN.tmp file in some idiotic
place other than the current directory (often in the root dir of the
joined filesystem, but not always).  Then, after deleting the original
*.doc file, it can't find the ~NNNNN.tmp file to rename it.  Unless you
search your disk systems, the document is gone.

I have also found subtle problems using the MKS toolkit from a DOS box
when JOINed filesystems are present.  I used to join c:\temp with a 4meg
ramdisk, but MKS sometimes gets confused when doing an ""ls"" on the c:\temp
dir, and misses some files in the temp dir.  (This is difficult to 
reproduce, but it goes away totally when JOIN is not used.)  I think
this is a Windows problem, rather than MKS's, since it works OK under raw
DOS.

So, I would suggest that you can use JOIN, but be aware that it may not
be as robust you would like.

Wouldn't it be real great to ""mount"" network drives (i.e. Z:) under the main
file tree, rather than having all those darned drive letters? Unfortunately,
JOIN won't let you do it.  There was talk on the net about a simple patch
to let JOIN work on network drives, but I don't remember the source.

It's too bad the JOIN command is not better implemented, since it would
avoid using all those stupid drive letters.  I realize that MessDos was
meant for casual, even ignorant users, so ""mounting"" all the drives in
one file tree might be confusing. But, it looks like MS is going to carry
this over into windows NT (another OS meant for casual, even igorant 
users -- NOT!).  With all it's old family system baggage, maybe MS needs
a recovery group so they can get on with life :-(.

What version of WinFAX do you have?  The newest version (3.0) has an OCR
(Optical Character Recognition) built in... what this means is that it can
take a fax (ie, a letter) and convert it into ASCII so that one can edit
the document w/o re-typing it... However, I found that the OCR that comes
packaged with WINFAX does not work as well as OMNIpage Professional (also
by Delrina software)... So, once again, WinFAX ver. 3.0 has what you are
looking for... Good luck!

If you wait until May the 18th you will be able to buy the new OS/2
2.1 since it will be released at Comdex that day. It will run Windows
3.1 apps and Windows enh. mode. If you can't wait, then you can ftp a
6 months old beta version from ftp-os2.nmsu.edu, but this version is
probably a lot slower than the final product.

When you do your test, please have in mind that a single tasking
system will always be faster at doing one task. The real power of OS2
lies in the multitasking and can't really be measured by a stopwatch.

Happy benchmarking.

   I have been using WinQVT/Net 2.81 under Win3.1 (dos 5.0) for quite
sometime without any problem.  I recently installed DOS 6.0 on my 386-40 PC
and I cannot run WinQVT/Net any more.  I keep getting ""Packet received for
invalid port-reset sent"" messages on the console window.  I can't
get more than 1 telnet window and can't use ftp!!!

   Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Well, you can't say that it don't work.  The inability to read 800k mac
disks is not a SW problem.  Rather, it's a HARDWARE limmitation on PCs. 

I have seen a post about a program able to read non-1.44Mb Mac disks,
which comes with a watchamacalit <ma memory's faling> card, which you
just drop into a com port or something.  Don't remember specifics, tho.

In the newer versions of Norton Backup for Windows (2.0 at least)
there is an ""emergency"" disk, which will allow you to restore
from tape without reinstalling DOS/Windows (I understand it's sort
of cumbersome to use, but not nearly as much as reinstalling
everything!)

Using the software you're using, I agree with you there.  What I did:
I installed DOS, Windows and CPBackup (functionally the same
as your Norton, for the purposes of this discussion), and used the 
DOS ""backup"" command on just that much.  To restore, I boot to the 
""system"" diskette, and use DOS ""restore"" to read in that much, then
boot to windows and restore my full backups using CPB (Norton, in your
case), overwriting what I've just restored.  That allows me to keep
this skeletal Windows essentially unchanged, with all my customization
on the ""real"" copy done using the 3rd-party backup utility.

Seems possible, if you can put skeletal versions of DOS and your backup
utility on a ""system"" floppy.  Then you could restore it all on one ""go"".

It will certainly *help* to be able to run Windows and Dos apps but
the only way that Solaris or OS/2 or any other scheme is going to 
challenge Microsoft is if they can somehow get the prices for Solaris
or OS/2 or whatever apps, down to a DOS competitive level.  Everybody
would rather run a Solaris app on a Solaris system and an OS/2 app on
an OS/2 system, they usually just can't afford a Unix system because
of the high prices for good Unix software.

The easiest way to do this is if you can send the files accross the network. 
This is much easier going from a Mac to a PC because you don't have to worry
about losing the resource fork of the file, often a problem when sending binary
files from a PC to a Mac.

I have just added a Panasonic KP-X1123 24pin dot matrix printer to a 386sx/25. I installed
the appropriate Windows 3.1 printer driver (i.e. one specifically for this printer) but I'm
unable to persuade the poxy thing to print correctly. 
 
What appears to be happening is that the TrueType fonts don't get printed properly. My
experiments show that all graphic images (for example a line drawing from Corel Draw) print
ok. GraphicsWorkshop for Windows happily prints GIFs etc. MS Notepad and MS Write will
print correctly providing the font's in the text are printer fonts. 
 
When I print TrueType fonts, some lines appear to be printed in the wrong order. If I change 
the text font to a printer font, the problem is eliminated.
 
I have tried using printer drivers for printers which the KX-P1123 (snappy name) emulates,
namely Epsom LQ-850 and IBM ProPrinter X24 and the same problem occurs.

Well, a few things might help you like the 3.1 File Manager better.

1) To get more than one window simply double click on a drive icon.
   That it only gives you one window to work with is a fallacy. You
   can drag files between windows, to any icon on the tree on the left
   side of the window, and to any drive icon. This beats your ""left
   and right window"" as you can have as many open as you wish instead 
   of just two.

2) You can launch any app from within File Manager by double clicking
   on the executable's icon.

3) You can launch any application and open a document file by double
   clicking on the document file's icon, provided you have
   associations set correctly. This is easily done with the menus. The
   ""browse"" capability adds a lot of functionality to 3.1. So if you
   name all your text files with .txt and point all GIF, TIFF, etc.
   files towards Paintshop or WinGIF, this takes care of your
   requirement for ""text reading and graphics viewing"".

I know someone who prefers using File Manager as his shell. Setting up
all the associations you need is the way to do it.

If Directory Opus is half as good as File Manager then it must be
pretty good indeed! File Manager just needs you to understand how
some things are done.

Very well indeed.  At home (a VL Bus version of the Graphics Pro) I can stretch
an AVI window to 640x480 and it will continue to play back smoothly.  It drops
a few more frames but on most machines even attempting such a thing would mean
one frame update every 30 seconds.  An ISA Graphics+ was able to do ""Zoom by
2"" without any perceptible performance penalty.  It is the best performance
I've seen so far with the possible exception of an Intel Indeo board (which
uses overlay so it doesn't have to move the decompressed data over the ISA
bus at any point).

InfoWorld (April 26, 1993 issue) has two articles about problems with DOS
6.  A 'Second Look' article calls it a 'loaded gun' and that people
should exercise extreme caution if they decide to use it.  The point out
that DoubleSpace and MemMaker are both problem areas that will cause a
number of folks problems.

MS's response was to the effect that there had been no problems reported
that they could duplicate (probably are not trying too hard).

Cringely reports that a lot of folks are getting/going to get burned
on the 900 support lines - his example was a call that cost $67.50, 
for 3 minutes of tech support after 25 minutes on hold.  I want to see

 I thought I'd reply to this, though I ain't brad.  AT any case, a lot
of picture-file viewers that will convert, say, between .gif,etc, to
.bmp *will* convert to .rle.  I Know for a fact that PaintShop
(shareware from cica; /desktop, I think, filename psVVV.zip (I think,
where VVV is the ver. number.  If that's not true, let me know and I""ll
post a corection).


This, however, will write your .rle file with a .bmp extension, so you
have to rename it.

NOW, another thing....
this is from the windows' FAQ:

your file has to be less than 64 K
( at least that's what the faq says, but Mine wont work for more than
about 30...maybe they mend 32K, I don't know).

Your file has to fit VGA size (480 * 860, or whatever standard vga size
is.)  If you use a non-vga screen (e.g. Cga, ega, svga, there is also a
way to do it, but I thing instead of vgalogo.lgo you use another file,
such as cgalogo.lgo, egalogo.lgo, or something.  I'm not sure about
this, as I have a vga, but i'm sure you could find it in the faq (a
windows help ver. of which *is* available at cica, but don't konw the
filename). 

ALSO....your .bmp has to be 16 COLOURS Or less.

These specs rule out some of the good .bmp's.  I found cartoon drawings
work quite well as they have the advantage of looking good with little
memory.

Finally, REMEMBER TO SAVE YOUR CURRENT WIN.COM before, and put your
new win.com in the windows directory.  Also, don't start windows from a
directory where another win.com is present, as *that* is used instead of
the one in the windows dir, and win. won't start.

I don't know the specifics of the compression algorithm, but I've used the
shareware program, PaintShop, to convert between the two.  You can download
it from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, but I don't know what the file is called
or what directory it is in (you can start by looking in pub/pc/win3 or try
scanning the index files).

To convert a .BMP file to a .RLE file, you just load the .BMP file and do a
""Save as...""  Select ""Windows bitmap"" and ""Compressed"" (or is it ""RLE""?)
Whatever it is, it's fairly intuitive...

Sorry I don't have all the details, but I'm currently on an IBM3151 dumb
terminal and can't do much researching...Good luck!

Subject: Local Windows .vs. Shared Windows (Discussion)
Organization: The Ohio State University, Department of Physics
Lines: 110

I would like to see a serious discussion on the best way to install windows
from a Novell administrator's point of view.
 
I just got off the phone with MS Access support and was told that they
(Microsoft) has decided to implement, as a standard for software support,
the LOCAL setup (described below) as the ""most advantageous installation"".
If this is true and Microsoft deems this to be the most prudent installation
then I will comply but I'd like to hear it from administrators first.
 
The LOCAL Windows Installation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Windows is fully installed on each workstation hard drive (assuming the
resources are available).  From a network administrator's implementation,
he/she would install all windows disks on a network drive using SETUP/A.
Then install windows on a per/machine bases by running SETUP off the network
to install the complete system on the local drives.  In this way, all drivers
are available to the SETUP procedure w/o the need to change disks.
 
Advantages:
- Reduce Traffic - Running Windows locally reduces network traffic due to
  the local access of main Windows files.
- Network independence - If the network fails (and they all do at one point
  or another), the local installation would allow users to keep producing
  and reduce the cost of down-time.
- Faster Windows - Theoretically, Windows will run faster from a local hard
  drive than over a network.  This may be a hard point to prove if the network
  has an optical backbone and/or the network drives are significantly faster
  access than local ones.
- A user traveling from machine to machine does not need to worry about
  varying setups (monochrome, color, types of mouse, etc...) since the
  Windows installation is assigned to the Workstation.
 
Disadvantages:
- Cost - Installing Windows locally requires a significant amount of disk
  space.  Workstations now must be purchased with a hard disk that can
  increase the cost of the workstation from 10 to 30 percent.
- Administration - Local windows installations are very difficult to
administer.
  New drivers for peripherals are constantly being made available, each of
  which would have to be individually installed on each workstation.
- Security - Users now have access to erase or corrupt their own system
  files from simple ignorance.  This could result in quite a headache for
  administrators who may have to constantly repair damaged installations.
- Backup - We all know the problems backing up local hard disks.  The backup
  sets (if done via a centralized tape system) get very large very quickly.
  Backup individually (to floppy) may not happen at all.  This may be
  eliminated if it is assumed that local hard disks only contain replaceable
  applications and *not* user data.
 
The SHARED Windows Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Windows is fully installed to a network disk via the SETUP/A procedure
described above.  Users (or administrators) then install a minimal set of
files to individual ""user"" directories.  These directories may be on a
local hard disk or perhaps a network ""home"" directory.  The bulk of the
Windows system files are maintained on the network in a single directory
(some 400+ files) and are accessed (shared) as-needed by users throughout
their Windows session.  The user's files consist of a small set of files
that the user has updated during his/her Windows session.  These include
group files, .INI files and other regularly updated files.
 
Advantages:
- A single location for all files makes updates to drives easy.  As
  an updated driver becomes available, it only needs to be installed in this
  single directory for all users to be able to take advantage of it.
- Assuming that the users' files are maintained in network (home) directories,
  the administrator can easily edit any .INI file as-needed to correct
  problems that may arise.  This includes WIN.INI and SYSTEM.INI.
- Backup of all pertinent files is done easily.  Even if the users' files
  are on a local hard disk, the bulk of the Windows system is backed up with
  all driver updates.
 
Disadvantages:
- Network traffic - since all Windows files are being shared in a network
  directory, traffic on the network can become a problem an effect the
  speed of Windows.
- If the network crashes, all production comes to a stop since Window's
  is reliant upon the network for its files.  Loss of data usually occurs
  as well since users working in Windows at the time of the crash will
  usually not be able to save their work.
- Although minimal, disk space is still a consideration.  If the users' files
  are maintained on the network, a large number of users can cause a
  significant utilization of disk space due to their personal Windows
  files alone.
- Users cannot easily move from machine to machine unless the workstation
  hardware are similar.  This is due to the Windows installation being
  tied to a particular username (in the case of Network user files).
  
The Discussion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I would like to know, from other administrators with a large Windows
userbase, how they prefer setting up Windows.  Personally, I have
setup numerous installations using the SHARED setup.  All Windows and
application files are on the network with little or no utilization of
local hard disks.  In fact, I sold a network on the fact that the
company would no longer need to purchase hard disks for their workstations
and thus save that much more money.
 
I would also like to see recommendations for applications.  Should
apps such as Word and/or Excel be installed locally regardless of how
Windows is installed?  Again, I keep all files on the network for easy
backup and administration but this is ""putting all eggs in one basket"";
if the network crashes, work comes to a halt.
 
Now I am sure Microsoft (and I know your out there) has their own
ideas about this and their insights would be of great value but I hope to
hear from people with ""actual"" working experience with users and network
administration.

Do you mean a prog. that doesn't jump to the DOS display and then back or 
create a temp. DOS window?

If yes then I might recommend WinZip from ftp.cica.indiana.edu.  I'm afraid 
I don't have the file name or version but you should be able to find it.

It's fully compatible with ver. 2.04g and very functional.

The sensitivity is changed using the /S, /V, or /H parameter.  
The commands do the following:
/V - vertical sensitivity
/H - horizontal sensitivity
/S - both 

Follow the parameter with a number from 1 to 100 (1 - slowest, 100-fastest).
The default is 50.  You can type the command ""mouse /S75"" right from the

Source for ""does not"" comment: the CD-ROM and manuals for the March beta
-- there *is* no X windows server there.

Will there be?  Of course.  (Even) if Microsoft supplies one with NT,
other vendors will no doubt port their's to NT.

According to a recent newsletter from Hummingbird Communications Ltd.,
they announced eXceede/NT at UNIFORUM 93.  The announcement reads like it
is ""here now"", but there is no order or price info.  I would guess it
must be RSN.  There is a dev kit too.

I have a 486 sx 25 and I recently added a SCSI drive to my system using an  
Adaptec 1522 (non busmastering) controller. Yesterday I ran coretest to  
find out drive performance and these are the values I got

Seagate 106 Meg: 875.1kb/Sec	14.5ms avg seek   3.7ms track to track 
Quantum 400 Meg SCSI: 991.2 Kb/sec  12.7 avg seek 3.6 track to track.

First off all are these good results? I don't know what typical values  
are.

What I'm wondering now is the following. My swap file is currently on the  
IDE. I could move it to the SCSI which is 13% faster, but then I would not  
be able to use 32-bit access which might actuall make it slower. So on  
which drive should I put my swap file to get best results? Is there a swap  
file speed test program out there?

Finally, I also ran the above tests with the ASPI2DOS driver loaded and I  
got no difference whatsoever in performance. Is there any reason at all  
why I should load this driver?

Thanks in advance, I will post a summary if I get enough responses.

Any one time means IMHO a single byte xfer. If I have four sources of
DMA requests ready, the DMA would service the one after the other. If
the bandwidth for the four together is lower than the ISA/DMA
bandwidth, this will work.

Note that the bus mastering here is the priority mechanism in the DMA
controller.

In a 25-pin serial loopback plug, you need to connect the following
pins:

pin 1 to pin 7
pin 2 to pin 3
pins 4, 5 and 8 together
pins 6, 11, 20 and 22 together
pins 15, 17 and 23 together,
pin 18 to pin 25.

That should do it.  Note that *a lot* of these pins are redundant
in many implementations....

I ran out of time on my last reply to this string and I don't
know if it was sent or not but. I have never heard of anyone that
had to return something in the 30 grace peried that had a problem
at all with Midwest Micro. They may of thought that you didn't
know what you were doing and suggested how to correct the problem.
But it sounded as you didn't give them much of a chance to correct
things at all. The fact that the PPI worked okay for you is because
it is setup more for the no nothing user that can't understand the
instruction and the commands to configure it to his/her system.
When you find out things like the fact the the EC led that looks like
you have connected to another EC modem, doesn't realy say that.
But that it only tells you that you have EC turned on, on your modem.
I think that these LED are nothing more that just light to hype up
the product. Just like I bet someone took home a few extra $$$
in the last year for giving the PPI modems the PC-Magazine award
of the year. Not so for the stash (12) of them that I saw on my test
bench. I could go on for hours at no end as to all of the problems
that I found with the PPI modems but I will try to control myself.
I will not even go into the 6 weeks it took PPI to credit my card
back for the modems after they had received them back...no I will
not go into that one nor will I go into talking to the parent co.
co from Hayes. I'll just say I hope you like your new modem and
maybe someone that can understand how to setup a modem will get
the one that you sent back, maybe a good friend of mine I hope!

This is normally the case, but make sure you get a board with a plug in oscillator
as you will screw up your warranty if you start to solder the board.

I own a PC FanCard II, which is a slightly different beast.  It's a long card
that plugs into an 8 or 16 bit slot and contains two muffin fans.  It requires
no extra cabling.  I had a 286 that was experiencing some problems due to
heat.  The FanCard made the system run cool enough so that the problem no
longer appears.  It's supposed to keep the internal temperature in the range
of 75-95 degrees Fahrenheit.  According to the maker's (M.S. Tech)
advertisements, the US Army used a bunch of these to keep their PCs running
(w/o a/c) in Desert Storm.  I can't vouch for that.  However, I am a satisfied
customer.  And I have no other connection with the maker or the mail-order
house (Lyben  (313) 268-8100).

Hope this helps,

   Even if you are running DOS, if your CPU can't handle the speed of the

I have a 486/50Mhz ISA Board with 256kbyte Cache and 16 Megs

installed that uses 16bit dma transfer. After I tested
the card the first time, the computer crashed and I got a
parity error-system halted. This happens either from dos as
also from windows. So it seems that my 16 bit dma channels
are not working properly (they are there because testsb16.exe
recocnize them and tests them ok until first access). 

Well, does anybody know a solution for this problem or a
special test program for dma problems? I eliminated the 
problem temporaly by using only 8 bit dma channel but it
makes the system slow!

Well, I have a different story to recount.  I attempted to low-level format a
WD 43MB disk about a year ago.  When I understood my error, I contacted WD.
They told me that I hadn't hurt the drive and that I should just run FDISK and
FORMAT/S on it.  It was fine.  Also, I understand that Western Digital's BBS
may have some low-level formatting routines specifically available for IDE
drives.  You probably need to talk to them and get the straight scoop.

Don't even get hyped up.  They are still accepting submissions from the
members for various proposals of how to implement the standard.

You don't seem to realize that while v32bis was just an extension of
v32 (which took years to pass, implement, and finally sell at a reasonable
price), v.fast requires all new technology (not just faster DSP chips, etc.)
to achieve its performance.

Wait until next spring for the final ratification and modems coming shortly
after that.

OK, here's my results so far....

1: You have to define the monitor as LCD - it doesn't really support
   Analogue video input (It works, but isn't very linear...)

2: The incoming sync pulses need inverting. This is best achieved
   with either a cmos XOR package or a transistor inverter.
   If you don't know how to do it, don't even contemplate it.. :-)

3: It'll only work in standard VGA mode.

OK, having said that, I'm trying to either find a circuit or IC
which will act as a universal sync decoder.

I want somethikng which basically only detects the leading sync
pulse edge, and doesn't care about the polarity, outputting
the -ve going pulses that the atari monitor requires.

There are 2 reasons for doing this

1: VGA cards change their sync polarity depending which mode they're
   in - herc emulation is +,- while MVGA is +,+ for example.

2: It means I don't have to put a toggle switch on the back of the
   monitor in order to be able to run it off both the atari and my
   IBM. Currently I have 3 (Yes, 3!) monitors sitting on my desk,
   and I want to get that number down as much as possible.
   Being able to use the atari monitor as a paper-white VGA
   will cut things down to 2. If I forget about Atari colour,
   I can get down to 1.

Ultimately, the best course of action is to get a multisync monitor,
but I'm as pressed for cash as anyone else, so it'll have to wait...

Would someone be willing to explain to me the 486DX 50MHz is not more
popular than it is?  I would think it would be just as fast, if not 
faster than the 486DX 66MHz for certian applications.  Plus, a 50MHz 
motherboard would seem better if you had any plans on upgrading the
chip in the future.  I must be missing something, since everyone is 
buying the DX2 66...  Many adds don't even mention the DX 50.

A couple of months ago I tried out a Hercules Graphite card.  A pretty nice
board.  Fairly fast, and seemed quite compatible -- even seemed to handle the
SVGA modes I have whined about here on occasion.  At the time I was just
buying a VLB system, so after checking out the card I sent it back.  I wanted
a VLB card, and purchased a Fahrenheit VLB card.  This card is fairly fast,
will do 70 Hz refresh at 1024x768, but is not compatible with my CD-ROMS
(the SVGA thing -- I think; I have merely conjectured that is the cause of
an old graphics board being able to run in a higher resolution with those
programs than the modern boards I have tried.  I have not gotten a straight
answer out of anybody...).  The monitor I am using it with is a 17"" Magnavox,
which also tops out at 1024x768x70 Hz so its really a pretty good match.

But...

That is for my wife.  I just purchased a Viewsonic 17 for myself, and am
looking for a graphics card to drive it.  I want > 70Hz refresh,
and would really like it to handle my CD-Roms.  I tried the Orchid P9000,
which did neither of those things (though Robert at Wietek did say that the
>70Hz was possible if I modifed the driver data base).  So my thoughts go back
to Hercules.  They were supposed to be coming out with a VLB version of the
Graphite around the end of March.  I have heard precisely ZERO about it since
then.  Does anyone know if the card was actually released, and what capabilities
(and price) it has?

Any info would be most appreciated.

It first depends on what an idle cpu is doing!

I'm not sure about DOS, but many multitasking OSs have an loop like this


loop:

The CPU is not doing any work but it is still processing instructions...

Yes, but what if my monitor only has 3 BNC's on it, and is expecting
to get a composite sync signal on the ""green""?  There ought to be a
little black box that takes the VGA signalling (which has horiz, vert,
and composite sync on different pins, plus the R, G, and B pairs) and
merges the green and composite sync together in the output.  It's all
1V analog, as far as I know.  I can build this with op-amps but I don't
think I can get the shielding done well enough to handle the frequencies
involved without lots of shadows and junk on the screen.

Does anyone know of a VGA->RGB(composite sync on green) converter?

You don't have to change the bios config.

It's transparent. It works with any drive. If you change the

Yes, no problem.

That depends. You will get a little better performance
if you use smartdrive and buffers in addition. That's
because access to the card through the ISA bus is slower
than access to system RAM. I don't use smartdrive myself,
but I have a few buffers.

I have had a SCSI and IDE drive working together for some years now.
SCSI is supposedly pretty transparent to other types of drives
(ESDI,RLL,IDE,etc) - but oftentimes you need to get the correct drivers
to get it to work with odd environments.

For information purposes, I had:

ST-01 Card + ST296N drive and a MAXTOR 212a drive with generic IDE
controller running together. I have also had the same SCSI setup work
in combination with a RLL drive, the ST251-1 drive.

Nntp-Posting-Host: brahms.udel.edu
Organization: University of Delaware
Lines: 43


I have uploaded the most recent Windows drivers for the Cirrus GD5426 
chip based display cards to the uploads directory at ftp.cica.indiana.edu
 (file is 5426dr13.zip). They're very recent, I downloaded them from the 
Cirrus BBS (570-226-2365) last night. If you are unable to get them there, 
email me and maybe I can upload them to some other sites as well.  
I have a local bus based card (VL24 Bitblaster from Micron) but I think 
the drivers work with ISA cards (or at least includes drivers for them).

I found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version, 
improving my graphic winmarks (v3.11) by about 2 million (7.77 to 9.88) 
although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on 
Cirrus's part but I don't think so.

From Steve Gibson's (columnist for Info World) graphic card comparisons 
(also found at the cica ftp site under the name winadv.zip) I extracted the 
following for the sake of comparison:

							Wintach
             		Winbn3.11	Word	Sprsht	Cad	Paint	Overall
Steve's system:
486/33 VLB:
ATI Graphics Ultra Pro	  9.33		10.34	 20.78	8.28	14.90	 13.58

my system -
486sx/33 VLB:
VL24 Bitblaster		  9.88		 8.65	 11.71	18.84	15.40	 13.65


Its no Viper, but I think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of 
the ATI card and when compared to the other cards included in Gibson's review.

Micron system owner's, I would be interested to hear your opinions on the 
DTC 2270VL local bus disk controller. My system came with a Maxtor 7120 
drive (120 MB) and at first was only giving me disk winmarks of about 16 Kb/s, 
I am now at 22 Kb/s. Is this about as good as it gets? I can't get a Norton's
sysinfo disk reading because the contoller intercepts the calls, at 
least that was what the program said.

He's right ya know.  I've helped to install Dos 6 on about 4 computers now,
mine included.  On one, he bought the Stacker to Doublespace converter,
and it worked fine (rather, he sent in the coupon for the converter).

In other cases, I've run the doublespace installation without a problem
when compressing a new drive, compressing free space, or whatever else.
Seems to work for me.

Well, I ran the normal SETUP thing and it worked fine for whatever that's
worth.

Couldn't agree more.  On my 486-50 I don't miss the speed.  It's still
faster than a normal disk read would be.  As for the less compression,
I've sacrificed that in favor of the convenience of having the dblspace.bin
load before anything else.  With Stacker, any changes to your config.sys
or autoexec.bat meant rebooting twice so it could update those.

Personally, I'm waiting for Stacker 4.0 to come out and implement those
hooks and stuff.  Plus, the DEFRAG that comes with DOS is okay, but I
much prefer COMPRESS from PC-TOOLS for sheer bells and whistles.  Plus,
defrag is sooooo sloooow on a dblspace drive.

Diamond Video cards (stealth, viper, speedstar, etc...) 
may have excellent specifications, and the windows drivers that
come with them might make windows BLINDINGLY fast, BUT:

If you're considering buying a system, with a view to using
it to run Unix (Linux, bsd, etc...) or some other special software,
there is a good chance that it WILL NOT WORK with the Diamond cards.
This is due to Diamond's propriety attitude to it's hardware:
it's impossible to get free information from them about their chips 
(specifically their dot-clocks) without paying, and signing non-disclosure
agreements.

This made it impossible for the Free Software Foundation to provide
X-Windows compatibility with these cards, as diamond didn't want to 
divulge programming neccessities.

As far as I know only Diamond has this propriety on it's info.

I'm arguing with the phone company about a similar problem.  We
installed a second phone line in our home (for our kids), and whenever
one of them is on THEIR line, the modem returns ""NO DIAL TONE"" on its
line.

When we pick up the phone and listen, we can hear my kids' voices
""bleed"" through.  Whenever we can hear this, the modem won't dial (even
though the dial tone is loud and clear through the modem speaker).

I think it's the phone company's problem, but they say they can't
(won't?) correct the problem...I'm still working on them. ;-}

Hope this helps.  I had exactly the same problems.  Unfortunately when

of a different FDC.  Seems (don't flame me, this is mainly guess work

The original poster, John Navitsky, said that he might use the monitor on
a SparcStation LX. The LX is able to generate a picture at 1280*1024 at
76 Hz. Not officially, but I tried to set this resolution and refresh rate
and the LX came up with a non-syncing screen. Our tube obviously couldn't
handle this speed. At 67 Hz, it worked perfectly.

When buying a third party monitor that's going to be used on a SparcStation
LX, you might consider a monitor that's fast enough to do 1280*1024 at 76Hz.
I don't know for sure whether the LX supports this (Sun certainly won't tell
you) so you'll have to check.

I am planning on upgrading my old XT compatible system with a new
motherboard, hard drive, and 1.4 MB floppy.

I am interested in using my old power supply (150 W) to power the new
hardware, if possible.  

I have been told by the motherboard vendor that I could probably
use the supply if it had twelve wires going to the motherboard.
(Apparently some XT vintage supplies had only 11 wires -- the
12th wire is a 5v line used to charge the motherboard battery).

My question is has anybody tried bringing an additional wire
out of an 11 wire supply OR using an auxiliary power source
to charge the motherboard battery?

I do not wish to buy an entirely new power supply if I can 
make use of my existing one with simple hacks.

Thank you for any information.  
An email reply to rarbanas@rcsuna.gmr.com would be fine.

I recall reading a review article in PC Computing wherein they reported
a reduction in the loading time for lengthy programs using Stacker 3.0.
This was not due to the compression algorithm per se, but to the fact
that fewer fetches were required during the sequential file access. Does
anyone have any actual performance numbers relating to speeds of Stacker

One of the things going for the DX2-66 (over the 50) is that it's
clock speed complies with the VESA local bus spec.

Most fellow Diamond video board owners with whom I've corresponded may
or may not share your opinion about the proprietary clocking scheme, but
all of those with whom I've chatted have NOT been thrilled with the
Window's drivers, either.  Some modes work fine, but others cause
strange misdrawn objects, trails, etc.  Many have also voiced their
strong discontent to Diamond's ambivalent attitude toward OS/2 drivers.

Come to think of it, though, I hear and see a lot of complaints about
the ATI boards too, though recent word looks like the build 59 code looks
much better.

Does ANYONE have an accelerated video board with drivers for Windows
(OS/2?) where ALL the modes function properly?  Anyone?  Anyone?

As far as I know, there is no way to get around the BIOS password except by 
shorting out the power supply to the CMOS memory, thereby erasing it. This 
will remove the password, but it will also destroy all the previous BIOS 
settings, so then you'll have to go and set them all up again. On my 386, 
there is a jumper on the motherboard which is provided for the purpose of 
shorting the battery. You just short this jumper briefly, and it interrupts 
power to the CMOS long enough to erase it. I would imagine there is 
something like this on your board too. 

In the future, I would suggest that YOU set the password, and leave it on 
""Setup"" only. That way, no-one else can go and reset it or set it to ""
Always"" unless they know what password you used. They had to do this over 
here too when they got a bunch of new 386's, for just the same reason.

This isn't quite true - depending on the number of local bus slots, and
whether or not the device is integrated into the mother board, it is
possible to run local bus at up to 40 and 50 mhz. I've also spoken to a few 
people who run standard local bus video cards at 50 mhz without trouble
(and a couple of people who couldn't get a lb card to work at that speed).

1. do not do a low level format on an IDE drive unless you have the
   executable for doing so supplied by the manufacturer.  These are
   available from bbs's or mail but the mail version costs a nominal
   fee.

2. In addition to the master/slave jumper on an IDE drive there is also
   another jumper to indicate whether a slave is present.  Get it right!

3. The cabling is not an issue as long as pin 1 goes to pin 1 goes to
   pin 1.  No twisting or swapping on an IDE cable.  Be sure of pin 1
   on all three components - do not make assumptions (guesses are ok
   but assumptions are bad).

4. If the cable and jumpers are correct, and the CMOS setup is correct,
   then you may have to do an FDISK followed by a high level format.
   I have NEVER personally found this necesary, but perhaps there is
   something gone wrong with the data on the disks?  Probably not but

hello,

i want to know if a spoilt com port will create problems with
mouse ??

my mouse just gets stuck on the screen for a while and i have
to press its button to be able to move it around again.....

is there a shareware utility program to diagnose my com ports?

Gateway service has confirmed my suspicion, echoed by a couple of people
who responded to the original request for help.  The ATI VLB video board
uses the addresses for COM 4.  They could suggest no work around.
I will be returning the DF IO card they supplied for COM 4 (even though it
could not possibly work) for credit against a bus mouse.  This will free
up the COM port I need - too bad the original salesman who suggested either
the DF IO card or the bus mouse would solve my need for a port didn't know
enough about the hardware.

Otherwise I must say that the 486DX2/66 system has worked very well - no
problems with any other hardware or software.

This is a fundamental aspect of Novell's business; they wouldn't be
where they are if they didn't live up to their ""Novell Does Printing""
slogan.  We run 6 printers of varying types off our Novell network;
I'm sure there are places with hundreds.

RTFM on the CAPTURE command, PRINTCON, PSERVER, and the sections of
the Windows 3.1 manual which cover network printing.  If you haven't bought
Novell's products yet, rephrase your question and look for information about
how *well* various competitors do printing.

Has anybody every come across a problem whereby a hard disk locks up (ie. crashes the system) when attempting to load disk caching?

I think the logic board may have been buggered, but the drive works PERFECTLY without a disk cache.

I tried HyperDisk and various versions of SmartDRIVE, all to no avail.

Any advice would be MUCH appreciated .. I need a cached drive, but I need the extra space of my second drive just as much! :-)

Thanks.

Below is the list of large (at least 18 inches diagonal) monochrome
monitors which Computer Shopper lists as PC compatible.  I've omitted
Radius because Radius states that they no longer support the PC.

You will notice that Nanao is the only one which supports a 31.5Khz
horizontal frequency, which is the frequency normally used by VGA cards
at boot up.  My guess is that all the other monitors come with their
own graphics cards.  I've left voice mail with Nanao asking them to
send me some literature, and will report back to the net after I've
studied it.

The prices given appear to be list prices and have little relationship

Actually, the iAPX86 family has a HALT instruction that causes the CPU to
cease processing instructions.  The CPU resumes processing either by being
reset or by receiving an external (hardware) interrupt.  This is different
from the power management facilities Victor mentions.  Of course, whether an
operating system's idle loop uses the HALT instruction is another matter
entirely.

I have both!

I have IDE only on my DROS box and IDE and SCSI on my Unix box.

IDE on the DROS box 'cos it only has a hard disk, SCSI on my Unix box 'cos it
has a SCSI hard disk, CD-ROM and tape.

I bought SCSI as it makes adding many devices easier. For the price of one
irq and dma I have three different types of device connected up.

Faster drives are also available for SCSI - I have a DEC DSP3085s that realy

Many state of the art SCSI disks use the *SAME* mechanicals as many state of the

Caching controller! Why? What does it give you that smartdrive ( for DOS ) does 
not? About 30KB extra lower memory! That's about it.

A properly configured main memory cache will produce better results than a caching
controller! My Unix reads reads data from its main memory cache at 8.5MB/s! That's
faster than the standards ISA bus can ever sustain!

Most likely reason is that your backup battery is failing - this battery 
maintains the contents of the CMOS memory when AC power is turned off, and
if the battery is flakey then the contents of the CMOS will be lost and 
the checksum will be wrong (along with most other of the CMOS data). Try 
replacing the battery.

If, however, your PC doesn't use a battery but a large capacitor to power
the CMOS, you should check to see if you can replace the capacitor with a 
more normal lithium battery. If this isn't possible, make sure you leave
your PC on for a half hour or hour each day; this will keep the capacitor 
charged. I'd opt for the battery change, though.

It's also possible, but unlikely that a rogue problem or even a virus is 
corrupting the CMOS. If your battery seems okay, get a virus scanner and
check out your system.

Which bus???

I think there are several reasons :-

50MHz motherboards are harder to get right
50MHz need a fast L2 cache - 12-15ns is a good idea
50MHz needs to be slowed down to make a compliant VESA bus
66MHz DX2 chips are faster for a lot of things


With a good, fast L2 cache a DX2/66 is going be be faster than a DX50...

What do I have?

A DX50 of course!

I have two SCSI hard drives, each has 512KB of 'cache'.

There several reasons for this :-

When the drive has read requested data from the disk the SCSI bus may be
busy. This data needs to be stored some where until the bus is free and
the data can be transmitted.

When the drive receives data to be written, the data can come down the bus
faster than the drive can write it to the disk. It needs to be stored
somewhere while the disk is writing it out.

In these situations the memory is being used as a buffer NOT a cache!

May be the drive does some read-adead caching as well...

I got a ET4000/W32 card which is made by Cardex yesterday
and ran a winmark test on it. The card is a VL-BUS card which
can display 16.7 million colours in 640x480 mode with 1MB DRAM.

It comes with ET4000/W32 window drivers and a normal Et4000 drivers.
The ET4000/W32 drivers handles, 640x480, 800x600, 1024x786 in 256 colours.
Also, in 640x480 and 800x600, it supports hicolor, 32K and 64K colours.

Here is my winmark result running on a 16MB 486DX33 EISA/VL-BUS system using
Hint chipsets.

Winmark 3.11 from ZD lab.

Using ET4000/W32 drivers
640x480 256       10.63 megapixel/sec.
        32k        7.34 
        64k        7.30
800x600 256       10.07
        32k        6.38
        64k        6.35
1kx786  256        8.17

Using ET4000 drivers.
640x480 16M        1.78
800x600  16colours 4.01     
1kx786   16        4.22

From the result, the ET4000/W32 drivers are specialized to use the
hardware feature of the Et4000/W32 chip whereas the ET4000 drivers are
just normal driver for ET4000 based graphics card.

The price of this graphics card that I got is $185 from a local dealer.
It may be less from mail order. It has OS/2 2.0 drivers comes with it
which supports 256 colors on all resolution.

From these results, it has double the performance of a Et4000AX based card
in 256 colours mode.

This is a common misconception, shared my many manufacturers, programmers,
and users alike.  COM3, for example, is simply the third equipped COMM
port, not necessarily the one with I/O address 3E8.  The BIOS just
searches sequentially through a set of potential COMM port addresses.  The
first equipped port it finds will become COM1, etc.  If you're playing by
the rules, you can't have a COM4 unless you have a COM3 equipped.  The set
of ""standard"" (whatever that means) port addresses merely reflects the
order in which the BIOS searches the I/O address space in its search for
serial ports.

So, what you have is indeed COM3 at the non-standard address 2E8.  Were
this address in the 4th table slot instead, programs which query the BIOS
to determine the number of installed COMM ports would not find it, as the
field in the BIOS data area which contains this number would indicate that
there are but 3 COMM ports installed.  (Frankly, I don't know of a simgle
program that would actually have a problem with this.)

THE PROBLEM:  I was sent Western Digitals ISPFMT low level program from

Just a small tidbit: with the advent of DOS 3.3 and later versions, MS added
a small ""feature"" to the DOS time function.  If a program sets the DOS clock

This breaks the isolation between the two clocks that used to ensure that

Call Phoenix.  They can put you on line with replacement BIOS chips.  I had
to do this when I upgraded a Emerson 386/20 to an IDE drive.

Also, if you are installing an IDE drive, and there is a BIOS setting that
has a total volume the same as the IDE drive's volume, try using it.  The
IDE drive can usually respond to a variety of different geometries, as long
as the setting that you use is equal to or smaller than the drive's actual
size.  The controller will do the necessary translation automatically, in
most cases.

WARNING!!!  Do not use a BIOS setting that is even one byte larger than the
actual size of the drive!  A smaller setting will not harm the drive, but
you will be sorry if you go even one byte over.  Drive damage will not
result, but headaches will!

It's not true.  IDE bus uses signals which has similar name and same
meaning to the counterpart of ISA bus but its (IDE bus) signal timing
doesn't have to be same to ISA signal timing.  My VL-IDE bus card has
a set of jumpers to set its transfer rate from 3.3MB/sec up to 8.3MB/
sec (the manufacturer might have to correct these numbers as 3.3
*milion* byte/sec and 8.3 *milion* byte/sec respectively).   You
cannot transfer data at a rate of 8.3MB/sec on the ISA bus.

Subject: Upgrading the processor on 386/486 machines
Organization: Harvard University Science Center
Lines: 43


In case anyone was wondering about upgrading their 386 or 486 class machine
without spending a lot of money, I looked into replacing the processor
on those machines and here are the facts (as I understand them).

If you have a PS/2 Model 70 or Model 80, you can replace the i386 chip with
either 1) a Cyrix 486DLC chip for $130 which will increase your processing
power by about 60% for normal fuctions, and not at all for math functions.
This chip will only run at your original clock speed, ie. if you have a 16MHz
machine the Cyrix 486DLC will run at 16MHz.
note: Windows does not use the math functions, so it is a good upgrade if
you are running Windows.
Or, 2) you can get a Kingston 486/NOW platform for $450 with a 25MHz i486SX
on it which will increase your normal processing power by about 100%, if you
were running at 25MHz originally. But again it will not increase the speed
of your math fuctions.  I think that it will continue to run at 25MHz even
if your original processor runs at a slower speed.
There is also 3) the Kingston 486/NOW platform for $750 with a 33MHz i486DX
on it.  This might speed up your math functions as well, but I am not sure.

If you have a PS/2 Model 70 B21 or other PS/2 machine with either an i486SX
or a non-clock doubling i486DX (ie. it runs at either 25 or 33MHz) in it,
then you can get an Intel Overdrive chip (which is really an i486DX2 chip) and
replace your chip with it.  You should get about 95% better preformance for
both normal and math functions.  The 25/50 Mhz version of the Overdrive chip
costs $450 and the 33/66MHz version costs $700.  The replacement for the
25MHz 486SX chip is an espeacially good deal as it provides the math
coprocessor which the 486SX does not have.  Note that the speed ratings on the
Overdrive chips are the maximum speed at which they can run.  If you have a
20MHz 486SX, then the Overdrive chip will run at 20/40MHz, ie. 20MHz externally
and 40MHz internally.  There is no reason to buy an Overdrive chip which is
rated at faster then your machine, you will not get faster performance.

You should be able to buy these chips from any of the microchip merchants that
advertise at the back of PC Magazine or PC Week.  You might want to shop
around as prices do vary.  If you need a name/phone number for a source for
a particular chip, e-mail me, and I will respond with a couple of sources.

I vote for turning them off at night.  THe stress of off/on is a little 
harmful, so don't turn it off, then back on an hour later, etc, but
turning them off for 4-5 hours or overnight is a good idea.

The electricy consumption will go down if you turn them off overnight, along
with heat. 

We have a lot of 10-year old machines in the basement that still work, but
who cares? (they are off 24 hours a day).

Well, I don't exaclty know what _should_ be done, but what I do is
keep my cpu on and turn my monitor off when not in use.  I do this as
much for easing power consumption as anything though.  Turning off the
monitor when not in use has the advantage of requiring less RAM than
a screen saver (but it requires more of MY memory to remember to turn
it off... pretty easy to remember to turn it on though :-)

Sure there are other considerations, but it goes to show you how

    Not without replacing most of the chips on the motherboard. The C610
isn't like the IIsi was, meaning that the motherboard of the C610 is 
actually designeds to run at the speed of the CPU, and not designed to
run at a higher speed (like 25MHz) but be forced to run at the speed of
a slower CPU (20MHz).

    There is more than one oscillator. If you are talking about the CPU

'040. At least this is what I have read in some other posts in this

Apple and several other manufacturers have already committed to a monitor

I wish I caught the original post, but anyway ...


The problem is that the Plus's poor old power supply (sometimes referred to as
the analog sweep board) is on its way out. Apart from a board swap (bikkies to
Apple), there's not much the average Joe can do to fix it.

You can, of course, try and re-adjust the voltage levels (the 5v rail should
be as close to 5v as you cn get it) but this is more often than not a
temporary fix. A copy of Larry Pina's ""Macntosh Repair & Upgrade Secrets"" is a
worthwhile investment for the serious do-it-yaself-er.

So is there any problems putting a drive formatted vertically on
its side horizontally?

I got a drive a few years ago with the rubber feet on the side,
etc. and have used it like that since (obviously designed for that
orientation). However, it doesn't fit under any of the clever
places I can think of to place it, so I would really like to lay it
flat and put it under a low shelf.

This is probably not a ""newer"" drive, and it is only 70 meg, but
when I bought it, it was a large drive for an average user
(comparable to buying a 200 meg drive today). So is my old, 70 meg
drive as fragile (or not) as a new 200 meg drive?

Just curious.....

I could plug the monitor directly into the computer so that when I hit

I can buy which allows me to plug my existing power cord into and then plug
this ""extension cable"" into my Quadra?

The supplemental manual that comes with the Quadra 800 explains it. I
don't have the manual in front of me, but as I recall, you insert the CD
while the machine is running, select Restart from the special menu, and
then hold down a special sequence of keys to force it to boot from the CD
instead of the hard disk. I think the key combination is
Command-Option-Delete or Command-Ctrl-Del.

    THe origional bit is missing but long/short follows:

    The origional poster asked if he/she could use any old vga/svga
monitor with a centris (hence title).  

    The answer ot this question is an unqualified yes.  You can use any
old vga/svga monitor with a centris.  You do need an adaptor (I use a
Mac vga-q from james engineering (510) 525-7350) to run between the two
machines.  THe adaptor I have mentioned will convert a centris to a
three row vga/svga 25(?) pin adaptor for your monitor.

    NOW, the special interest disclaimer.
 The above answer is correct for using a vga monitor at 600x400
resolution.  IF your monitor will sync to 56Khz horizontal the above
adaptor will allow you to choose 800x600 resolution (I prefer this on my
1604s).

THen You have the question of matching adaptors and sync rates.  I would
advocate calling James engineering because they seem to have a clue.  As
to the comment by the person who said don't bother calling Apple because
they will treat you like an idiot this is totally untrue.
    APPLE WILL TREAT YOU LIKE A F**KING ASSANINE IDIOT FOR EVEN
CONSIDERING GOING THIRD PARTY AND IF YOU WANT THIS TREATMENT WANTS YOU
TO PAY FOR THEIR THECH SUPPORT LINE (the supposedly compitantly one) AND
THEN STILL HAS NO FU***** CLUE.

personal experience.  also the tech suppport for the vga monitor makers
doesn't see to extend to Macs (Sony, Magnavox).  In addition to this to
find out the info you will have to call dealers unless you can find the
sync rates elsewhere as ads like Hardware that fits
(*&^%&%^%$$(&**&^(%&%^$!) that rate monitor resolutions give the most
favorable rating (which usually means you can get this if you use a
specialized application video card).(i.e. ""well you can get a resolution
1168x832 on this $5,  9"" ""super smelly sock"" monitor that will let you
display TWO FULL PAGES side by side.  All you need is our reasonably
priced ""oder eater"" video board for $27,000 and it will give you an
ultra fast horizontal sync rate of SIX fast kilohertz and three Khz
vertical."")



Note:  with the sony 1604 at least on the centris 610 built in video
board using an 832x624 adaptor, there is a boarder of an inch + to the
sides of the image after adjusting the horizontal width as favorably as
possible.  Using a 800x600 adaptor this can be reduced to about half an
inch.

                                                                    -A.

No.  I recently bought an LC II with a 14"" monitor.  The monitor comes with
the type of power cable that plugs into the switched outlet on the back of
most larger Macs.  Since the LC II doesn't have one of these outlets, there
was an extra standard power cable included with the computer for use with
the monitor.  But it was in the computer box, not the monitor box.  It's
not as if the cables are particularly expensive, though.  $10-$15 at the
most.

There are two approaches:

1. If your power cord is the kind that detaches from the back of the
monitor (most common) you can get a *replacement* power cord that will go
from the monitor to the back of the computer.

2. You can get an adpater that connects to the plug end of the existing
power cord and provides the proper end that plugs into the back of the
computer.

Both cost about the same (aprox. $5) and are available from many computer
stores (clone dealers are usually better at having these things and at
good prices). Power cords are standard, so you don't have to go looking
for some special thing at a Mac store.

PSI makes an internal fax modem for the map portable (1-800-622-1722) but 
asks too much for it (retail $450). I'd buy an external and save about 
$350. 

there is a manufacturer that still makes INTERNAL HD's for the portable, 
they're listed in some of the catalog ""magazines"" for apple stuff you can 
find at bookstores. If I see it again I'll post it. But, again, you might 
want to just add a small lightweight external HD built for the 
powerbooks. You'd be able to use it with a new computer some day. Any 
other mac portable questions, I'll have to cry uncle.

Don't blame me. I voted for XXXXXXX.

    The Performas are made to be low-cost, widely distributed (sold at

    Sears is probably going to have the best price around, most of the

    Not really. The newer Peformas (405, 430, 450) come with what is
really a third party monitor that Apple has put their name on and
called it the Performa Plus display. Essentially it is a VGA monitor,
quite cheap.

I'm not an expert, but having spent much too much of my life looking for
the power switch, or the brightness control, or the de-gauss, etc., etc.,
etc. it is my firm belief that the only reason any
controls/switches/knobs/whatever in places where they are hard to reach is
because the designers put them there deliberately.

The real question is weather this is because of stupidity, or

Larger drives tend to have multipule platters which can allow adjacent
bits to be read in parallel resulting in higher throughput.  They also
have higher spindle speeds which leads to both increased throughput and
reduced seek times (due to reduction of rotational latency.)

I have done several of these upgrades (about 6 IIsi's, and 1 Quadra 700), and
the best thing to use would be some sort of ""heat sink compound"". If possible,
you should look for the silicon-free stuff. There's a comany who makes the stuff
called Tech Spray, their address is: P.O. Box 949, Amarillo, TX 79105.

You should be wary in using most kinds of tape; and definately don't use duct

When using the heat sink glue or compound, only use enough to fill the small

It's made by (SURPRISE) National Instruments:
6504 Bridge Point Parkway
Austin, TX 78730-5039
(800) 433-3488
anonymouse ftp at: ftp.natinst.com

Their 1991 catalog lists the NB-8G as follows:

fetch and deposit DMA controller (8 channels)
IEEE-488 interface with data rates up to 850 kB/sec, with DMA and
programmed I/O
   transfers
8 16-bit counter timer channels
RTSI bus (that's the connector on the top of the board - it links it with
   other National Instrument boards
List price of $1295

The board isn't in later catalogs: it has been superceeded by the

My Centris 610 is working perfectly.  There is one problem that I have

is that it works with my friend's 610 most of the time, however, it never
works with my machine.  I assume it is some sort of software problem and

Hmmm... that's not quite right.  The Performa 600 is Real Darn Close
to the IIvx (but a better buy IMO).  I also don't think they are so
much a 'low-cost business solution', but a low-cost _home_ solution.
Why else bundle at ease (among other things)?  Hardly a business
application. 

What do you mean by 'no ""retail price""'.  Quite the contrary, I think.
The price is darn near the same all across the country.  That (again,
IMO) was one of the selling points of the performas -- ie: no haggling
required.  Kinda like the Saturn (car) of the computer set.  One
price, medium performance, ready to go.

When I shopped for my Performa (600CD), the difference between Sears
(*sigh), Montgomery Wards, Silo (*sigh), Circuit City (*sigh*) and
Bizmart (*sigh*) couldn't have been $100.00.  Why I chose one over the
other was based solely on availability and a friendly salesman who
went the extra mile (when did you last hear that about someone who
sells Apples?).  Admittedly, except for Montgomery Wards (and I
suspect I was just lucky) all of the salesfolk I spoke to didn't know
didly about the computers, peecee or mac.  But then, neither did any
of the  Apple dealers I spoke with...

If you would've told me a year ago that I would buy a Macintosh from
Montgomery Wards I woulda laughed for a long, long time.  Go figure.
I'm *real* happy with my Performa.  Oh, and I bought the Apple
Performa Plus monitor (vs. buying 3rd party).  Happy with that
decision as well.  I walked in, plopped down some cash, and walked out
with a spankin' new computer the day before Christmas.

Nope.  I keep my Mac running all the time since it also acts as a
usenet node and exchanges mail and news every half hour (I run uAccess)
and receives all my faxes.

I do turn off the monitors hooked up to it.  They produce more heat
than I want - it can be warm in my garage office in the summer.  I've
got one of those handy power control centers ($25 at Fry's) to I just
flip the switch in front when I start or stop working.

By the way, this strategy seems to be somewhat endorsed by Apple since
their new Color Classic will turn off its own monitor after a certain
length of idle time.

Subject: MACINTOSH LAB!!! HELP!!!
Organization: Wittenberg University

Interesting delema for all those out there.
My school is discussing installing a Mac lab of 10 to 15 stations for our Bio
100 to 103 classes to do a study with pig disections.  (no joke)  Here is the
deal. We can get this grant to do a study on if it is more feasible to do a
disection via the computer or via the real thing.  My problem is I was somehow
drawn into this project (being done by students who want to go Mac but know
NADA about them, being the man mac man on campus, guess who they came to?) so I
wnt to know what would probably be the best hardware to fill the follwoing
list?  Right now we are looking at the C650 8/80 and the 2vx 5/80 platforms.
Ok here it goes:

	We are using cd-rom, so ought we go with the internal Apple Cd-roms
offered as options in the 650 and vx or go external. It is a matter of price
and reliability, the second being VERY important.
	How much RAM?  I was thinking 5-8 more leaning towards 8?  What do you
think?
	Ok, called apple educational discounts and they said their keyboard
(extended) is 160.30. Is it better to go with the Apple and their long time
great wear and tear record, or is there a 3rd party extended keyboard that is
just a reliable?  Price?
	Printers:  One color printer we are presently leaning towrds the
Thermal Wax Tektronic 200e or 200i (Probably the e as we are going to limit
access so we don't needed the i's networkability)  So, what do you think in
terms of color printers?  Different brand?  Kind (Dye Sublimation?  Ink Jet?) 
Price? Companies?  1800 #s?  Also, we are looking to get a laser printer or
such to network into the whole lab for noraml printing.  The fornt runner is
the Apple Pro650 (is that right don't have my notes here?) at 1650. 
Suggestions?  We have kids using these things all day if this lab goes through
and they know nothing about it for the most part. It has to be reliable, easy
to maintain, and economical (ie, not high priced paper cartidges, etc).
	Finally, and this is my little dig into the Project. What about netting
these things?  We have ether nearby and I would like to slap the macs on the
net, but, server?  Individual ether?  Forget about it it is going to be
astronomically priced and the school is going to laugh at you when you ask
them?
	Little more info, I am a Poli Sci major who just happens to know alot
about macs but this is a bit out of my league, not to mention I don't have the
time to go and look for all of this stuff. So I am hoping the collective
resources and intelect of the net can help (Has before) [Shameless plug: BUY

	Disclaimer:  This post is not and will never be supported by my

Depends on the price you can get the ci for. Educationally speaking,
the 4/80 [?] LCIII here at FSU can be had at just under $1300. Add
in roughly $500 for a monitor. Last I'd heard, an 8mb LCIII simm
went for ~$250. 

I think you're in a win-win situation. No matter what you decide,

I am using a NEC 4FG with my Centris 610. The cable adapter was provided by
NEC (you have to call to get this free adapter). I am also sharing it with my
486 (using a switch box and extra cables).

My questions: 

	How do you tell if it is 600x400 or 800x600 that was displayed?
	Or how do you change the mode(resolution)? 
	Is there SW for this or something I have to do with the HW?

I am assuming I am getting 800x600 since I have 1M VRAM and the 4FG can display
1028x768(?) with my 486.

I don't know the answer to your direct question, but if the Mac Superdrive can  
read MS-DOS disks (can it??) then you can transfer files between the NeXT and  
a Mac by using MS-DOS formatted disks since the NeXT *can* read/write that  
format.  And if you're interested in transferring files, you can also do it  
over the serial port using kermit.

Here's the story:

(1)  The IIsi *cannot* supply a VGA output.  However...

(2) Some VGA-type monitors can adequately deal with the video signal
the Mac uses to drive the Apple 13 or 14 inch ""high resolution color
display""---i.e., Apple's own 640x480 mode.

So, if you wish to hook one of these monitors up to your IIsi, you
need (a) an adapter that converts from the Mac DB-15 connector to the
VGA-style high density DB-15 connector, *but* tells the Mac to use
it's own 640x480 mode, not the VGA 640x480 mode, and (b) a VGA monitor
that can deal with the higher bandwidth of the Mac 640x480 mode over
the VGA 640x480 mode (which as I stated in (1) above, the IIsi cannot
produce).

As far as (a) above is concerned, contact

 James Engineering, Inc.
 6329 Fairmount Ave.
 El Cerrito, CA  94530
 510-525-7350
 FAX: 510-525-5740

They can probably get you the right adapter.  Remember: you do *not*
want the run-of-the-mill Mac-to-VGA adapter, because it will try to
have your IIsi produce the VGA mode, which it cannot (the computer
will just fail to produce any video signal at all).  Instead, you want
an adapter that connects between the Mac-style and VGA-style
connectors, but tells the Mac to use the Apple 640x480 mode.  Sorry
for the poor terminology available for describing this distinction.

As far as (b) is concerned, make sure to get a monitor that can deal
with a horizontal bandwidth of 35 KHz and a vertical retrace rate of
67 Hz.  These are the spec's of Apple's 640x480 mode.  For comparison,
the VGA-standard 640x480 mode uses a 31.5 KHz horizontal bandwidth and
a 60 Hz. vertical retrace rate.

The monitor will probably need to have auto-synch'ing capability, as
the Apple mode you'll be using isn't one of the set of standard modes
in the PC compatible world.

Good luck!

All you have to do is buy a MacroMedia MacRecorder. This plugs into your
seril port and acts as a microphone. North Star computers should be able

Well, almost NuBUS 90 anyway, comprehensive bus contention between processors
is not supported in the current Macintoshes, could be wrong?

However, I know for a fact from seeing the Cyclone Data Spec sheets myself,
don't ask, Macintosh Cyclone models will provide full implementation of the
NuBUS standard.

Very interesting possibilities indeed!

Hi.

He needs insert the MO before FileSharing get turned on, and the only one
that can see the disk is the owner of the machine. (I'm not sure but seems
that the check ""Allow owner to see entire disk"" should be enabled too).

A bad thing: you can't eject the disk until FS is turned off.

Hope that helps.

I too had a very unpleasant experience with ""Hardware That's Shi*"". It
featured repeated lies about when things had shipped, a salesperson who
was totally ignorant about what he was selling, a charge for duties I
had specifically been assured were not payable and then a monitor (their
house brand 2-page monochrome) that was the most unadulterated piece of
junk it has ever been my misfortune to experience in the world of
electronics.

I shipped it back and they refunded my money, but it still cost me
something over $200 for long distance charges, non-refundable taxes
and duties and lost time.

Don't deal with them.

 ==================== 
 I HAVE A QUESTION...  (1.0)
 ====================
  
       Congratulations!  You've come to the right place.  Usenet is 
  a wonderful resource for information ranging from basic questions
  (How do I lock a floppy disk?) to queries that would make Steve
  Jobs himself run screaming from the room in terror.  (I used
  ResEdit to remove resources Init #11, WDEF 34, and nVIR 17 from my
  system file and used the Hex Editor to add code string #A67B45 as a
  patch to the SFGetFile routine so the Standard File Dialog Box
  would be a nice shade of mauve.  Everything worked fine until I
  installed SuperCDevBlaster, and now when I use the Aldus driver to
  print from PageMaker 5.0d4 to a Linotronic 6000 my system hangs. 
  P.S.  I'm running System 6.0.2 on a PowerBook 170.) 
  
       Since the Macintosh newsgroups are medium to high volume, we
  ask that you first peruse this FAQ list including at least the
  table of contents for the other pieces of it, check any other
  relevant on-line resources listed below in question 1.2, especially
  the FAQ lists for the other Macintosh newsgroups, and RTFM (Read
  the Friendly Manual) before posting your question.  We realize that
  you are personally incensed that the System is taking up fourteen
  of your newly-installed twenty megs of RAM, but this question has
  already made its way around the world three hundred times before,
  and it's developing tired feet.  Finally, before posting to any
  newsgroup (Macintosh or otherwise), please familiarize yourself
  with the basic etiquette of Usenet as described in the newsgroup
  news.announce.newusers.


 HOW DO I USE THIS DOCUMENT?  WHERE CAN I GET IT?  (1.1) 
     
         comp.sys.mac.faq is currently divided into multiple pieces,
  a general introduction which you're reading now, and specific lists
  for the newsgroups comp.sys.mac.system and comp.sys.mac.misc.  FAQ
  lists for comp.sys.mac.wanted, comp.sys.mac.apps and
  comp.sys.mac.hardware are in development.  When ready each part
  will be available in its respective newsgroup.  All pieces are
  available via anonymous ftp from rtfm.mit.edu in the
  pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh directory. Except for this
  document itself which is named general-faq.Z the pieces are named
  as per the last part of the newsgroup they cover  followed by
  ""-faq"", e.g. system-faq.Z, misc-faq.Z.  The .Z means the  file is
  stored compressed so you'll need to ftp it in binary mode and use
  either MacCompress, StuffIt Deluxe, or the UNIX uncompress command 
  to decompress it.  However if you leave off the "".Z"" extension when
   you ""get"" the file, rtfm will automatically decompress the file
  before sending it to you. 
  
         This introductory document is posted to all of the concerned
  newsgroups.  The tables of contents for each of the specific FAQ
  lists are at the beginning of this file so you should be able to
  get  at least some idea whether your question is answered anywhere
  else in the FAQ even if you don't have the other parts at hand. 
  It's not always obvious, especially to newcomers, where a
  particular question or comment should be posted.  Please
  familiarize yourself with the FAQ lists in all the major Macintosh
  newsgroups before posting in any of them.  Which questions appear
  in which FAQs can serve as a basic guide to what posts belong
  where. 
  
         To jump to a particular question search for
  section-number.question-number enclosed in parentheses.  For
  example to find ""Where can I FTP Macintosh software?"" search for
  the string  ""(2.1)"".  To jump to a section instead of a question
  use a zero for  the question number.


 WHAT OTHER INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE?  (1.2)

      comp.sys.mac.faq provides short answers to a number of 
  frequently asked questions appropriate for the Usenet newsgroup
  comp.sys.mac.misc and comp.sys.mac.system.  Four other files are
  worthy of particular note: Daryl Spitzer maintains a FAQ list
  covering Macintosh programming for the newsgroup
  comp.sys.mac.programmer.  It's posted to that group weekly and 
  available for anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.uoregon (128.223.8.8) in 
  /pub/mac.  Eric Rosen maintains a frequently asked questions list 
  for comp.sys.mac.comm available in that newsgroup and from
  rascal.ics.utexas.edu in mac/faq (where the file you're reading now
  is also irregularly archived).  This list answers many frequently
  asked questions about networking, UNIX and the Mac,
  telecommunications, and foreign file formats.  Norm Walsh has
  compiled an excellent FAQ for comp.fonts that answers a lot of
  questions about the various kinds of fonts and cross-platform
  conversion and printing.  It's available in comp.fonts or by ftp
  from ibis.cs.umass.edu in /pub/norm/comp.fonts/FAQ*.  Finally Jim
  Jagielski maintains a FAQ for comp.unix.aux covering Apple's UNIX
  environment, A/UX.  It's posted every 2 to 3 weeks in comp.unix.aux
  and news.answers. It's available for anonymous ftp at
  jagubox.gsfc.nasa.gov.


 WHICH NEWSGROUP SHOULD I POST TO?  (1.3)
  
      There are no stupid questions, but there are misplaced ones. 
  You wouldn't ask your English teacher how to do the definite
  integral  of ln x between zero and one, would you?  So don't ask
  the programmer newsgroup why your system is so slow when Microsoft
  Word is in the background.  Ignorance of basic netiquette is not an
  excuse. If you want people to help you, you need to learn their
  ways of  communicating.  
  
      Posting questions to the proper newsgroup will fill your
  mailbox with pearls of wisdom (and maybe a few rotten oysters too
  :-) ).  Posting to the wrong newsgroup often engenders a thundering
  silence.  For instance the most common and glaring mispost, one
  that seems as incongruous to dwellers in the Macintosh regions of
  Usenet as would a purple elephant to Aleuts in the Arctic, asking a
  question about networking anywhere except comp.sys.mac.comm,
  normally produces no useful responses.  Posting the same question
  to comp.sys.mac.comm ensures that your post is read and considered
  by dozens of experienced network administrators and not a few
  network software designers.
  
         Please post to exactly ONE newsgroup.  Do not cross-post. 
  If a question isn't important enough for you to take the extra
  minute to figure out where it properly belongs, it's not important
  enough for several thousand people to spend their time reading. 
  For the same reason comp.sys.mac.misc should not be used as a
  catch-all newsgroup.
  
         The breakdown of questions between different newsgroups in
  this document can also serve as a reasonable guide to what belongs
  where.  Specifically questions about productivity applications
  (software you bought your Macintosh to run, not software you bought
  to make your Macintosh run better) should go to comp.sys.mac.apps
  unless the application is covered in a more specific newsgroup. 
  Communications programs, games, HyperCard, compilers and databases
  all have more topical comp.sys.mac.* newsgroups.  Post questions
  about non-communications hardware including questions about what
  software is necessary to make particular hardware work to
  comp.sys.mac.hardware.  Questions about MacOS system software
  belong in comp.sys.mac.system.  Questions about utilities and
  extensions normally belong in comp.sys.mac.misc.  Questions about
  A/UX go to comp.unix.aux.  Detailed questions about Appletalk
  belong in comp.protocols.appletalk.
  
         Direct questions about HyperCard to comp.sys.mac.hypercard. 
  Non-HyperCard programming questions and questions about development
  environments should go to comp.sys.mac.programmer.  ResEdit
  questions may be posted either to comp.sys.mac.misc,
  comp.sys.mac.system, or comp.sys.mac.programmer; but generally the
  netters who inhabit the darker recesses of comp.sys.mac.programmer
  are considerably more practiced at the art of resource hacking. 
  
         A general exception to the above rules is that any VERY
  technical question about an application that actually begins to
  delve into the how's of a program as well as the what's (Recent
  example: How does WriteNow which is written entirely in assembly
  compare to other word processors written in high level languages?)
  might be better addressed to the programmer newsgroup.
    
         For Sale and Want to Buy posts should go to
  comp.sys.mac.wanted and misc.forsale.computers.mac ONLY.  We
  understand that you're desperate to sell your upgraded 128K Mac to
  get the $$ for a PowerBook 180; but trust me, anyone who wants to
  buy it will be reading comp.sys.mac.wanted.  Political and
  religious questions (The Mac is better than Windows! Is not! Is
  too! Is not! Is too! Hey! How 'bout the Amiga! What about it? Is
  Not! Is too!) belong in comp.sys.mac.advocacy.  Anything not
  specifically mentioned above probably belongs in comp.sys.mac.misc.
  
         Finally don't be so provincial as to consider only the
  comp.sys.mac newsgroups the appropriate forums for your questions. 
  Many questions about modems in comp.sys.mac.comm are much more
  thoroughly discussed in comp.dcom.modems.  Questions about Mac MIDI
  are often better handled in comp.music even though it's not a
  Macintosh specific newsgroup.  Shop around.  Usenet's a big place
  and not everything relevant to the Macintosh happens in
  comp.sys.mac.


 4. SOMEONE JUST ASKED WHY THE SYSTEM WAS TAKING UP SIXTEEN OF
 THEIR  TWENTY MEGABYTES OF RAM.  SHOULDN'T I PUT MY BRILLIANCE AND
 WIT ON  DISPLAY FOR THE WORLD BY POSTING THE SEVENTEENTH RESPONSE?

      No.  Frequent answers are just as boring and uninteresting as
  frequent questions.  Unless you really have something new to add to
  the traditional answers (such as the recent discovery that fonts in
  System 7.1 could eat memory) private E-mail is a much better medium
  for answering common questions like this one.
   
         You might want to add a mention of this FAQ in your E-mail
  response and a polite suggestion that your correspondent read it
  before posting future questions.  I do read all the newsgroups
  covered here and have written a small script in MicroPhone II that
  lets me send PWFAQ's (people with frequently asked questions) the
  section of this document that answers their question with just the
  click of a button so please don't feel obligated to respond to
  someone who cares so little about the answer to their question they
  can't be troubled to read the FAQ list to get it.

 FTP  (2.0)

 WHERE CAN I FTP MAC SOFTWARE?  (2.1)

      The three major North American Internet archives of shareware,
  freeware, and demo software are sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6),
  mac.archive.umich.edu (141.211.165.41), and wuarchive.wustl.edu
  (128.252.135.4) which mirrors the other two sites and several
  others. Wuarchive often holds on to files after other sites remove
  them for space concerns, and still has files that were deleted from
  the formerly important site, rascal.ics.utexas.edu.  Rascal was
  notable for storing its files in MacBinary format rather than the
  less efficient BinHex format common at the other archives.  Unless
  otherwise noted shareware and freeware mentioned in this document
  should be available at the above sites.
  
       To keep traffic on the Internet manageable, Scandinavians 
  should try connecting to ftp.funet.fi (128.214.6.100), ftp.lth.se
  (130.235.20.3), or sics.se (192.16.123.90) instead.  Those in 
  the U.K. should look first at src.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.2.1). 
  Continental Europeans can try nic.switch.ch (130.59.1.40),  
  ezinfo.ethz.ch (129.132.2.72), and anl.anl.fr(192.54.179.1). 
  Australian users should try to find what they want at archie.au
  (139.130.4.6) which mirrors info-mac and mac.archive.  Japanese
  users will find sumex mirrored at ftp.u-tokyo.ac.jp
  (130.69.254.254). 

         A fourth very important site is ftp.apple.com (130.43.2.3). 
  This is Apple's semi-official repository for system software,
  developer tools, source code, technical notes, and other things
  that come more or less straight from Apple's mouth.  Some material
  at this site may not be distributed outside the U.S. or by other
  sites that don't have an official license to distribute Apple
  system software.  Please read the various README documents
  available at ftp.apple.com for the detailed info if you're
  connecting from outside the U.S. or if you wish to redistribute
  material you find here.


 CAN I GET SHAREWARE BY E-MAIL?  (2.2)

      The info-mac archives at sumex-aim are available by E-mail from
  LISTSERV@RICEVM1.bitnet (alternately listserv@ricevm1.rice.edu). 
  The listserver responds to the commands $MACARCH HELP, $MACARCH
  INDEX, and $MACARCH GET filename.  Mac archive files are available
  from mac@mac.archive.umich.edu.  Send it a message containing the
  words ""help"" and ""index"" (no quotes) on the first two lines of your
  message for instructions on getting started and a list of the files
  you may request.  You can retrieve files from other sites by using
  the server at ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com.  For details send it a
  message with just the text ""help"" (no quotes).


 WHERE CAN I FIND APPLICATION X?  (2.3)

      If you can't find what you're looking for at one of the above
  sites, try telnetting to your nearest archie server or sending it
  an E-mail message addressed to archie with the subject ""help."" 
  Archie servers are located at archie.rutgers.edu (128.6.18.15,
  America), archie.mcgill.ca (132.206.2.3, the original archie server
  in Canada), archie.au (139.130.4.6, Australia), archie.funet.fi
  (128.214.6.100, Scandinavia), and archie.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.3.7,
  the U.K. and the continent).  These sites index the tens of
  thousands of files available for anonymous ftp.  Login as ""archie""
  (no password is needed) and type ""prog filename"" to find what
  you're looking for or type ""help"" for more detailed instructions. 
  For instance you would type ""prog Disinfectant"" to search for a
  convenient ftp site for Disinfectant.  If the initial search fails
  to turn up the file you want, try variations on and substrings of
  the name.  For instance if you didn't find Disinfectant with ""prog
  Disinfectant"", you might try ""prog disi"" instead.  Substring
  searches often hide the gold in a pile of dross.  To avoid many
  erroneous matches add a "".*\.hqx"" to the end of the substring, e.g.
  ""prog disi.*\.hqx""  Most Mac software available on the net ends in
  .hqx but almost no UNIX or PC software does. 

         Please check the above archives and ARCHIE personally BEFORE
  asking where you can find a particular piece of shareware.  If you
  follow the above advice, you should almost never have to ask the
  net where to find a particular piece of software.


 CAN SOMEONE MAIL ME APPLICATION X?  (2.4)

      No.  Nor will anyone mail you a part of a file from
  comp.binaries.mac that was corrupt or missed at your site.  Please
  refer to the first questions in this section to find out about
  anonymous FTP, archie, and automatic E-mail servers.


 WHAT IS .BIN? .HQX? .CPT? .ETC?  (2.5)

      Most files available by FTP are modified twice to allow them to
  more easily pass through foreign computer systems.  First they're
  compressed to make them faster to download, and then they're
  translated to either a binhex (.hqx) or MacBinary (.bin) format
  that other computers can digest.  (The Macintosh uses a special
  two-fork filing system that chokes most other computers.)  BinHex
  files are 7-bit ASCII text files, while MacBinary files are pure
  8-bit binary data that must always be transferred using a binary
  protocol.
  
         How a file has been translated and compressed for
  transmission is indicated by its suffix.  Normally a file will have
  a name something like filename.xxx.yyy.  .xxx indicates how it was
  compressed and .yyy indicates how it was translated.  To use a file
  you've FTP'd and downloaded to your Mac you'll need to reverse the
  process.  Most files you get from the net require a two-step
  decoding process.  First change the binhex (.hqx) or MacBinary
  (.bin) file to a double-clickable Macintosh file; then decompress
  it.  Which programs decode which file types is covered in the table
  below.  Also note that most Macintosh telecommunications programs
  will  automatically convert MacBinary files to regular Macintosh
  files as they are downloaded.

***************************************************************************

     A few notes on the decompressors:

      StuffIt is a family of products that use several different
  compression schemes.  The freeware StuffIt Expander will unstuff
  all of them.  Versions of StuffIt earlier than 3.0 (StuffIt 1.5.1,
  StuffIt Classic, UnStuffIt, and StuffIt Deluxe 2.0 and 1.0) will
  not unstuff the increasing number of files stuffed by StuffIt 3.0. 
  You need to get a more recent version of StuffIt or StuffIt
  Expander. 
    
         StuffIt 3.0.5 (Lite and Deluxe) consistently makes smaller
  archives than any other Macintosh compression utility.  To allow
  maximum space for files on the various ftp sites and to keep
  net-bandwidth down, please compress all files you send to anonymous
  ftp sites with StuffIt 3.0.5.
   
         UUTool, MacCompress, and SunTar handle the popular UNIX
  formats of  uuencode (.uu), compress (.Z), and tar (.tar)
  respectively.  The UNIX versions are often more robust than the Mac
  products, so use them instead when that's an  option.  Translators
  that allow StuffIt Lite to expand uuencoded and tar files are also
  available by anonymous ftp. 
  
         Macutil is dik winter's package of UNIX utilities to
  decompress and debinhex files on a workstation before downloading
  them to a Mac. Since UNIX stores files differently than does the
  Mac, macutil creates MacBinary (.bin) files which should be
  automatically converted on download.  It can't decompress
  everything. In particular it can't decompress the new StuffIt 3.0
  archives. :-(  However, if you need only one or two files out of an
  archive--for instance if you want to read the README to find out if
  a program does what you need it to do before you download all of
  it--macutil is indispensable.  It can be found at sumex-aim in the
  info-mac/unix directory.

     A few notes on the compression formats:

      .bin:  These are MacBinary files.  Always use a binary file
  transfer protocol when transferring them, never ASCII or text. 
  Most files on the net are stored as .hqx instead.  Only rascal
  stores most of its files in .bin format.  Most communications
  programs such as ZTerm and MacKermit are capable of translating
  MacBinary files on the fly as they download if they know in advance
  they'll be downloading MacBinary files.
  
      .image: This format is normally used only for system software,
  so that on-line users can download files that can easily be
  converted into exact copies of the installer floppies.  Instead of
  using DiskCopy to restore the images to floppies, you can use Steve
  Christensen's freeware utility  MountImage to treat the images on
  your hard disk as actual floppies inserted in a floppy drive. 
  MountImage has a reputation for being buggy, so you should have
  some blank floppies and a copy of DiskCopy handy just in case.
  
      .sea (.x, .X):  .sea files don't merit a position in the above
  table because they're self-extracting.  They may have been created
  with Compact Pro, StuffIt, or even DiskDoubler; but all should be
  capable of decompressing themselves when double-clicked.  For some
  unknown reason Alysis has chosen not to use this industry standard
  designation for self-extracting archives created with their 
  payware products SuperDisk! and More Disk Space.  Instead they 
  append either .x or .X to self-extracting archives.


 HOW CAN I GET BINHEX?  STUFFIT?  ETC.?  (2.6)

      By far the easiest way to get these programs is to ask a human
  being to copy them onto a floppy for you.  If you're at a
  university there's absolutely no excuse for not finding someone to
  give you a copy; and if you're anywhere less remote than McMurdo
  Sound, chances are very good that someone at a computer center,
  dealership, or user group can provide you with a copy of StuffIt. 
  Once you have StuffIt (any version) you don't need BinHex.
    
         If you're such a computer geek that the thought of actually
  asking a living, breathing human being instead of a computer 
  terminal for something turns you into a quivering mass of 
  protoplasmic jelly, you can probably download a working copy  of
  StuffIt from a local bulletin board system. 
  
         If you have religious objections to software gotten by any 
  means other than anonymous ftp, then I suppose I'll mention that 
  you can in fact ftp a working copy of StuffIt though this is by 
  far the hardest way to get it.  Ftp to wuarchive.wustl.edu and 
  login.  Type the word ""binary.""  Hit return.  Type ""cd
  mirrors/rascal.ics.utexas.edu/compression"" and hit return.  Then
  ""get StuffIt_Expander_1.0.1_SEA_bin""  and hit return.  Of course
  it's always possible that by the time you read this StuffIt
  Expander will have been updated and the name changed so if this
  fails look for something similar.  If you've ftp'd straight onto
  your Mac you should now have a self-extracting archive which will
  produce a working copy of StuffIt Expander when double-clicked.  If
  you've ftp'd to your mainframe or UNIX account first, you still
  need to use a modem program to download it to your Mac.  Just make
  sure that the Mac is receiving in MacBinary mode and the mainframe
  is sending in binary mode.  If you need more details on the last
  step, consult the FAQ list for comp.sys.mac.comm and the manuals
  for both your mainframe and Macintosh telecommunications software.
  
  
  HOW CAN I GET BINHEX, STUFFIT, ETC. FROM A PC?  (2.7)

       You can't.  There is absolutely NO way to get an executable
  Macintosh file from an ftp site onto a PC and then onto your Mac
  without some software obtained by means other than anonymous ftp.
  You MUST beg, borrow, or steal the necessary software such as
  Binhex or StuffIt Lite from another person.  I realize this may 
  terrify those among you who haven't left your parents' basement 
  since you got an  Apple II+ in 1980, but eventually you're going 
  to need to link up with some human being other than your mother.  
  (though I suppose if you're this much of  a nerd you could send 
  your mother out to get it for you.)  While you're gathering
  your nerves for a venture into the strange and terrifying world 
  of daylight, please don't bother the net by asking this question
  again.  There simply is no way to move executable Macintosh
  programs from a PC or other non-Macintosh computer onto a 
  Mac without software that is not bundled with most Macs.



=================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING: WHAT TO DO (BEFORE POSTING) WHEN THINGS GO WRONG (3.0)
================================================================= 

         While the various FAQ lists cover a lot of specific
  problems, there are far more problems that aren't covered here. 
  These are a few basic techniques you should follow before asking
  for help.  You should probably also perform the ten-step
  preventative maintenance routine described in section four,
  especially rebuilding the desktop (4.3) and resizing the system
  heap (4.5).  Following these steps may  or may not solve your
  problem, but it will at least make it easier  for others to
  recommend solutions to you.

 IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM.  (3.1)

      ""Microsoft Word is crashing"" doesn't say much.  What were you
  doing when it crashed?  Can you repeat the actions that lead to the
  crash?  The more information you provide about the actions
  preceding the crash the more likely it is someone can help you. 
  The more precisely you've identified the problem and the actions
  preceding it (Step 1) the easier it will be to tell if the
  following steps fix the problem.  For example, ""Sometimes
  QuarkXPress 3.0 crashes with a coprocessor not installed error."" is
  not nearly as helpful as ""QuarkXPress 3.0 crashes when I link two
  text boxes on a master page when copies of those text boxes already
  contain text.""  The former will leave you wondering whether the bug
  remains after a given step.  The latter lets you go right to the
  problem and see if it's still there or not.


 READ THE READ ME FILE.  (3.2)

      Many companies include a list of known incompatibilities and
  bugs in their READ ME files.  Often these aren't documented in the
  manual. Read any READ ME files to see if any of the problems sound
  familiar.


 CHECK FOR VIRUSES.  (3.3)

      Run Disinfectant or another anti-viral across your disk.  Virus
  infections are rarer than most people think, but they do occur and
  they do cause all sorts of weird problems when they do.


 REINSTALL THE APPLICATION AND ALL ITS SUPPORT FILES.  (3.4)  
   
       For half a dozen reasons (external magnetic fields,
  improperly written software, the alignment of the planets) a file
  on a disk may not contain the data it's supposed to contain.  This
  can cause all types of unexplained, unusual behavior.  Restoring
  from original masters will normally fix this.


 REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE.  (3.5)  

      Bits are even more likely to get twiddled in the system file
  than in the application and the effects can be just as disastrous. 
  See question 4.6 for a detailed procedure for performing a  clean
  reinstall. 
  
         If the problem continues to occur after you've taken these
  steps, chances are you've found either a conflict between your
  application and some other software or a genuine bug in the
  program.  So it's time to


 ISOLATE THE PROBLEM.  (3.6)  
 
         You need to find the minimal system on which the problem
  will assert itself.  Here are the basic steps of isolating the
  cause of a system or application crash:
  
     a.	Run only one application at a time. Occasionally applications do
     conflict with each other.  If the problem does not manifest itself
     without other applications running simultaneously, you can begin
     launching other applications until you find the one that causes 
     the crash.
     
     b.	If you're running System 6, turn off MultiFinder.  If you're
     running System 7, allot as much memory to the application as you 
     can afford.  Sometimes programs just need more memory, especially 
     when performing complicated operations.
     
     c. If you're running System 7, turn off virtual memory and 32-bit
     addressing.  There's still an awful lot of System 7 hostile
     software out there including some from companies that really 
     have no excuse.  (Can you say Microsoft Word 5.1, boys and girls?  
     I knew you could.)  Some of this software only expresses its 
     incompatibilities when certain uncommon actions are taken.
     
     d.	Boot from a virgin system floppy.  If the problem disappears
     you likely have an init conflict.  You need to progressively remove
     extensions until the problem vanishes.  Use a little common sense
     when choosing the first extensions to remove.  If the problem occurs
     when you try to open a file, remove any inits that mess with the
     Standard File Open procedure such as Super Boomerang first.  If the
     problem remains after the obvious candidates have been eliminated,
     either remove the remaining extensions one at a time or, if you have
     a lot of them, perform a binary search by removing half of the
     extensions at a time.  Once the problem disappears add half of the
     most recently removed set back.  Continue until you've narrowed the
     conflict down to one extension.  When you think you've found the
     offending init restart with only that init enabled just to make 
     sure that it and it alone is indeed causing the problem.


 CONTACT TECHNICAL SUPPORT.  (3.7)

      By now you should have a very good idea of when, where, and why
  the conflict occurs.  If a tech support number is available for the
  software, call it.  If you're lucky the company will have a work
  around or fix available.  If not, perhaps they'll at least add the
  bug to their database of problems to be fixed in the next release.

    

 ====================== 
 PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE  (4.0)
 ======================

      You wouldn't drive your car 100,000 miles without giving it a
  tune-up.  A computer is no different.  Regular tune-ups avoid a lot
  of problems.  Although there are Mac mechanics who'll be happy to
  charge you $75 or more for the equivalent of an oil change, there's
  no reason you can't change it yourself.  The following nine-step
  program should be performed about every three months. 


 TRASH UNNEEDED FILES  (4.1)

      Many of the operations that follow will run faster and more
  smoothly the more free disk space there is to work with so spend a
  little time cleaning up your hard disk.  If you're at all like me,
  you'll find several megabytes worth of preferences files for
  applications you no longer have, archives of software you've
  dearchived, shareware you tried out and didn't like, announcements
  for events that have come and gone and many other files you no
  longer need.  If you're running System 7 you may also have several
  more megabytes in your trash can alone.  Throw them away and empty 
  the trash.


 RETHINK YOUR EXTENSIONS  (4.2)

      Some Macintoshes attract inits like a new suit attracts rain. 
  Seriously consider whether you actually need every extension 
  in your collection.  If you don't use the functionality of an
  extension at least every fifth time you boot up, you're probably
  better off not storing it in your System Folder where it only takes
  up memory, destabilizes your system, and slows down every startup. 
  For instance if you only read PC disks once a month, there's no
  need to keep AccessPC loaded all the time.  Cutting back on your
  extension habit can really help avoid crashes. 


 REBUILD THE DESKTOP  (4.3)

      The Desktop file/database holds all the information necessary
  to associate each file with the application that created it.  It
  lets the system know what application should be launched when you
  open a given file and what icons it should display where. 
  Depending on its size each application has one or more
  representatives in the desktop file.  As applications and files
  move on and off your hard disk, the Desktop file can be become
  bloated and corrupt.  Think of it as a Congress for your Mac. 
  Every so often it's necessary to throw the bums out and start with
  a clean slate.  Fortunately it's easier to rebuild the desktop than
  to defeat an incumbent. 
  
         One warning: rebuilding the desktop will erase all comments
  you've stored in the Get Info boxes.  Under System 7 Maurice
  Volaski's freeware init CommentKeeper will retain those comments
  across a rebuild.  CommentKeeper also works with System 6 but only 
  if Apple's Desktop Manager extension is also installed. 
  
         To rebuild the desktop restart your Mac and, as your
  extensions finish loading, depress the Command and Option keys. 
  You'll be presented with a dialog box asking if you want to rebuild
  the desktop and warning you that ""This could take a few minutes."" 
  Click OK. It will take more than a few minutes. The more files you
  have the longer it will take.  If you're running System 6 you may
  want to turn off MultiFinder before trying to rebuild the desktop.
   
          If you're experiencing definite problems and not just doing
  preventive maintenance, you may want to use Fifth Generation's
  freeware init Desktop Reset.  Desktop Reset completely deletes the
  Desktop file before rebuilding it, thus eliminating possibly
  corrupt data structures.    


 ZAP THE PRAM AND RESET THE CLOCK  (4.4)

      All Macs from the original 128K Thin Mac to the Quadra 950
  contain a small amount of battery powered RAM to hold certain
  settings that properly move with the CPU rather than with the disk
  such as which disk to boot from.  Unfortunately this ""parameter
  RAM"" can become corrupted and cause unexplained crashes.  To reset
  it under System 7 hold down the Command, Option, P, and R keys
  while restarting your Mac.  Under System 6 hold down the Command,
  Option, and Shift keys while selecting the Control Panel from the
  Apple menu. Click Yes when asked if you want to zap the parameter
  RAM.  Since you've erased almost all the settings in the General
  Control Panel, you should now reset them to whatever you want.
   
         The one setting that zapping the PRAM does not erase is the 
  date and time; but since the internal clock in the Macintosh is
  notoriously inaccurate you'll probably want to take this
  opportunity to reset it anyway.


 RESIZE THE SYSTEM HEAP  (4.5) 

      Even after rethinking their extensions as per step two most
  people still have at least half a row of icons march across the
  bottom of their screen every time they restart.  All these
  extensions (and most applications too) need space in a section of
  memory called the System Heap.  If the System Heap isn't big enough
  to comfortably accommodate all the programs that want a piece of
  it, they all start playing King of the Mountain on the system heap,
  knocking each other off to get bigger pieces for themselves and
  trying to climb back on after they get knocked off.  All this
  fighting amongst the programs severely degrades system performance
  and almost inevitably crashes the Mac.
  
         If you're using System 7, your Macintosh will automatically
  resize the system heap as necessary; but if you're running System 6
  it's important to set your system heap size large enough to manage
  all your extensions and applications.  By default this size is set
  to 128K, way too small for most Macs with any extensions at all. 
  The system heap size is stored in the normally non-editable boot
  blocks of every system disk.  Bill Steinberg's freeware utility
  BootMan not only lets you resize your system heap but even checks
  how much memory your heap is already using so it can tell how much
  needs to be allocated.  If you're running System 6, get BootMan,
  use it, and be amazed at how infrequently your Macintosh crashes.


 REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE  (4.6)

      System files can become corrupt and fragmented, especially if
  you've stored lots of fonts and desk accessories inside them. 
  Merely updating the System software will often not fix system file
  corruption.  I recommend doing a clean reinstall.  Here's how:

    1.  Boot from the installer floppy of your System disks.  
    2.  Copy any non-standard fonts and desk accessories out 
        of your System file into a temporary suitcase.
    3.  Trash the System file on your hard disk.  Also trash the 
        Finder, MultiFinder, DA Handler, and all other standard Apple 
        extensions like Control Panel and Chooser.  These will all be 
        replaced in the new installation.  If you're running or 
        installing System 7, move everything in the Extensions, 
        Control Panels, and Preferences folders into the top level 
        of the System Folder.
    4.  Rename the System Folder.  Any name other than System Folder 
        is  fine.
    5.  Double-click the installer script on your System disk.  Then 
        choose Customize...  Select the appropriate software for your 
        model Mac and printer.  You could do an Easy Install instead, 
        but that will only add a lot of extensions and code you don't 
        need that waste your memory and disk space.
    6.  Once installation is finished, move everything from the 
        temporary folder you created in step 4 into the new System 
        folder.  If you're asked if you want to replace anything, you 
        forgot to take something out in step 3.  You'll need to replace 
        things individually until you find the duplicate piece. 
    7.  Reinstall any fonts or DA's you removed in step 2.
    8.  Reboot.  You should now have a clean, defragmented System file 
        that takes up less memory and disk space and a much more stable 
        system overall.


     DISK UTILITIES  (4.7)

      Much like system files hard disks have data structures that
  occasionally become corrupted affecting performance and even
  causing data loss.  Apple includes Disk First Aid, a simple utility
  for detecting and repairing hard disk problems, with its System
  disks. It's also available for anonymous ftp from ftp.apple.com in
  the  directory dts/mac/sys.soft/hdsc.  Even if you have an earlier 
  version, you should get the latest version (7.1) from ftp.apple.com
  and run it on all your hard disks.
     
         Several companies have released payware disk utilities that
  detect and repair considerably more problems than Disk First Aid
  though, interestingly, none of them detect and repair everything
  that Disk First Aid does.  The three most effective for general
  work are Central Point's MacTools Deluxe 2.0, Fifth Generation's
  Public Utilites, and Symantec's Norton Utilities for the Macintosh
  2.0.  A department or work group should have all of these as well
  as Disk First Aid since none of them fix everything the others do. 
  For individuals MacTools ($48 street) is about half the price of
  Norton ($94 street) or Public Utilities ($98 street) so, features
  and ease of use being roughly equal, I recommend MacTools.
   
         All of these products occasionally encounter problems they
  can't fix.  When that happens it's time to backup (4.7) and
  reformat (4.9).


     BACKING UP  (4.8)

      This is one part of preventative maintenance that should be
  done a LOT more often than every three months.  The simplest back
  up is to merely copy all the files on your hard disk onto floppies
  or other removable media.  If you keep your data files separate
  from your application and support files then it's easy to only back
  up those folders which change frequently.  Nonetheless every three
  months you  should do a complete backup of your hard disk. 
  
         A number of programs are available to make backing up
  easier.  Apple included a very basic full backup application with
  System 6.  With the Performas Apple ships a new Apple Backup
  utility that can backup the entire disk or just the System folder
  onto floppies.  The previously mentioned Norton Utilities for the
  Mac and MacTools Deluxe 2.0 include more powerful floppy backup
  utilities that incorporate compression and incremental backups.
  
         Finally if you're lucky enough to have a Tape Drive, network
  server, or removable media device to use for backups, you should
  check out the more powerful payware utilities Redux ($49 street,
  doesn't support tape drives) and Diskfit Pro ($74 street).  There
  are NO freely available backup utilities other than the old HD
  Backup from System 6.  


 DISK DEFRAGMENTATION  (4.9)

      As disks fill up it gets harder and harder to find enough free
  space in the same place to write large files.  Therefore the
  operating system will often split larger files into pieces to be
  stored in different places on your hard disk.  As files become more
  and more fragmented performance can degrade.  There are several
  ways to defragment a hard disk.
  
         The most tedious but cheapest method is to backup all your
  files, erase the hard disk (and you might as well reformat while
  you're at it.  See question 4.10.), and restore all the files.
   
         A number of payware utilities including Norton Utilities for
  the Mac and Mac Tools Deluxe can defragment a disk in place, i.e.
  without erasing it.  Although the ads for all these products brag
  about their safety, once you've bought the software and opened the
  shrink-wrap they all warn you to back up your disk before
  defragmenting it in case something does go wrong.  There are NO
  freeware or shareware disk defragmenters so please don't annoy the
  net by asking for one. 


 REFORMAT YOUR HARD DISK  (4.10)

      Just as a floppy disk needs to be initialized before use, so a
  hard disk must be formatted before it can hold data.  You don't
  need to reformat every three months; but when your system is
  crashing no matter what you try, reformatting is the ultimate means
  of wiping the slate clean.  Reformatting your hard disk may even
  gain you a few extra megabytes of space.  Not all hard disks are
  created equal.  Some can hold more data than others.  To facilitate
  mass production and advertising without a lot of asterisks (* 81.3
  megabytes is the average formatted capacity.  Your mileage may
  vary.)  Apple often formats drives to the lowest common denominator
  of drive capacity.  When you reformat there's no reason at all not
  to reclaim whatever unused space Apple's left on your disk.
     
         Unlike floppies hard disks need a special program to
  initialize them. Most hard disks come with formatting software. 
  Apple's disks and System software ship with HD SC setup, a minimal
  disk formatter which will format Apple brand hard drives ONLY. 
  Most other manufacturers ship appropriate formatting software with
  their hard drives.  Normally this will be all you need to reformat
  your hard disk.
  
         A number of general-purpose formatters are also available
  which go beyond the bundled software to include features like
  encryption, password protection, multiple partitioning, faster disk
  access, System 7 compatibility, and even compression.  Two of the
  best are the payware Drive7 and Hard Disk Toolkit Personal Edition
  ($49 street for either).  While there are one or two freeware
  formatters available, none are likely to be superior to the ones
  bundled with your hard disk. 
  
         PowerBook users should be sure to turn off Sleep and
  processor cycling before reformatting their hard drives no matter
  what software they use.  Otherwise disk corruption, crashes, and
  data losses are a very good possibility.

Um... they've sold the Cray. They realised that spending two years on
numbercrunching the finite stress analysis figures for the complex
injection-molded cases was not the way to go, and was holding up
development work.
Especially when the first FEA model for the portable left out the battery
cover, and it had to be redone. That's why the portable was about three
years late.

Designing metal cases is easier - they're managing with the Calculator DA,
now it can compute 45/100-0.45 correctly.

Any other suggestions?

Put me down for a PB100 4/20 with ext. floppy, AppleTalk Remote Acces,
AC adapter, and fresh out of box (was used, but buyer switched to 140
on arrival and sold unopened box. Purchased last October for $925.
Later I bought a used PowerPort V.32 9600 bps internal fax-modem for
something like $225, I'm using right now! Works great!  :)

No real complaints. I love my portable system (got a color home setup
also. Mac II). Reasoning was that MATLAB programs at school and other
simulations of dynamic control systems sometimes took hours (or
overnight) to run, tying up my Mac II. I got the PB100 with fast modem
to do light work and on-the-run stuff. I figured I'd give it to my
little sister next year when she goes to college. It's running System
7.1 now without any problems. Also I sometimes do DEC4015 terminal
emulations with MATLAB on our university's VAX_VMS (nice thing that it
benchmarks itself as an average of 230 times faster than a mac IIfx).
So, the PB100 just does graphical output and terminal emulation (not
too hard at all for it). It was a FABULOUS setup !!!!  :)  Weeee!!!

(By the Way, all MATLAB software was on class accounts. I was also the
TA for a class that used SIMULAB/SIMULINK. We had site-license and
take-home, then-destroy later site-release licenses... No pirating
there, incase you're wondering.... Great Program!!! )

Just like to add, whatever future system you get, you can almost never
get enuff memory.... Buy it while it's cheap - that is buy it when you
get the computer since it's usually cheaper than upgrading... I ALWAYS
run out of disk space... But I have a syquest on the Mac IIsi, so I
never worried about space before... Got several carts).

[ This would make me a bit suspect of Mr. Ramsey's qualifications

Yes, one can sometimes get away with running a newer ROM (of the 
correct size, obviously) in an older machine, but one should be 
prepared for problems if running software that checks for machine 
type rather than ROM trap availability and then draws incorrect 
conclusions when special-casing - especially timing-dependent
and driver-related stuff.

In this particular case I see no reason to go to the trouble 
of ROM-swapping.  The Apple 32-bit enabler has problems, but
MODE32 works just fine with 7.0, 7.0.1, and 7.1.

>Does anyone know of a source for these ROMs?  

Sure.  Buy a used IIci motherboard.  Call Pre-Owned Electronics,
Shreve, or other parts dealers (see the back of Computer Shopper
or one of the Mac trades for phone numbers) and ask for a price
on a IIci ROM.  Everything has a price.  If you happen to find
somebody who salvaged a IIci with a dead motherboard, you might
get a decent price.  There is probably a market for used mother-
boards as well, so they might sell a ROM anyway.

>Needless to say, I'm interested in purchasing such a ROM.  What would
>be a reasonably price to offer?

Ask for a quote and then try offering less?  Pre-Owned and
Shreve have been known to dicker.  Their ads in various trade
magazines often list considerably different prices for the 
same items, and their phone quotes tend to vary as well.

Still, I'm not aware of any technical reason for upgrading 
the ROM in a IIx.

I am *almost* done porting XFree86 1.2 to a new piece of display
hardware, but have run into a snag I think may be somewhat
commonplace, so I'm sending a net-feeler.

I have a display that is a non-interlaced, memory mapped, 1-bit
720x280 display.  The server's view of the world, (obtained via xwd |
xwud), seems to be exactly what it should be.  However, the displayed
version of the framebuffer gives the impression that the server is
using scanlines that are too long.  After a bit of experimentation, it
seems that the problem was that the server was padding the line out to
a word boundry, but the scanline size in the buffer is 90 bytes, which
isn't exactly divisible by four.  Changing the following defines in
mit/server/include/servermd.h:

----

#define BITMAP_SCANLINE_PAD  32
#define LOG2_BITMAP_PAD		5
#define LOG2_BYTES_PER_SCANLINE_PAD	2

---

to:

---

#define BITMAP_SCANLINE_PAD  16
#define LOG2_BITMAP_PAD		4
#define LOG2_BYTES_PER_SCANLINE_PAD	2

---

Was not exactly the right solution.  How do I tell the server either
(a) don't pad the scan lines at all ('cause this server is only being
built to run on this particular display), or to pad only to byte
boundries?

I'm using a customized version of XFree86v1.2, under Mach 3.0.

Thanks

Judging from the responses so far, I have not made clear enough in my
article quoted above that Imake-TeX is not for installing TeX, but for
*using* it. With Imake-TeX, you will never again have to fiddle around with
calling latex and its various utility programs (makeindex, bibtex). Simply
type ""make"" and your document's DVI file will be up-to-date. All you have
to do is to write a simple Imakefile and let Imake generate a suitable
Makefile for you. Here is such an Imakefile:

	#include ""TeX.tmpl""
	PaperFormatA4()
	SimpleLatexTarget(document)

The generated Makefile provides the following commands:

    make depend:    Searching the TeX source files for dependencies like
                    \input{somefile}

    make dvi:       Generate an up-to-date DVI file

    make viewdvi:   Display it on your screen

    make ps:        Generate a PostScript version of your document

    make viewps:    Display it

    make clean:     Remove unnecessary things

    make veryclean: Remove even the DVI file

    make Makefiles: Generate Makefiles in subdirectories


If ...

a) ...this seems attractive to you,
b) ...you are willing to test Imake-TeX and send me a short test report,
c) ...you are willing to cope with a rudimentary English documentation
   (however, the German version is completed and included),

then you are invited as a beta tester. I am looking forward to your e-mail.

In X10, the drawing attributes were bundled into drawing
requests;  that is, the server's drawing model was stateless.

This caused problems with performance and network traffic,
so the X11 redesign included the graphic context to codify
the drawing state.  Most application designers who want to
draw things in several different colors create a GC for
each color during initialization, then pass the GC id in
each drawing request.

For more information see Scheifler and Gettys's article
in the 1986 ACM Transactions on Graphics.

	Several ways are available -- pageview (which I think came

the new xv 3.00 package all do so.  I recommend the latter two,
especially xv if you want to do any conversion.

For flexibility. Anyway, what you say is not really true. The color information
is associated with a GraphicsContext, not with a display, and the GC _IS_
a parameter to the drawing routines.

So, if you need to fast switch between green dotted lines and blue ones of
width 2, you can make 2 GCs for those cases and then simply do

XDrawLine(dpy,win,gc_red,x1,y1,x2,y2);
XDrawLine(dpy,win,gc_blue,x3,y3,x4,y4);

for this effect.

This is eventually more complicated to do for the programmer, but also much
more efficient and flexible. You would not include all the other parameters
like line pattern, with, cap and joinstyle, drawmode and so on in every
drawing call, so why do it for color ? BTW, stay away from XDrawPoint()
if you don't really need it (to draw RANDOM points), for image transfers
there are Image routines.

I have the task to program a X application for the first time and have some severe difficulties creating a window in which I can draw something.
Unfortunately some basic books on the topic of X application programming are not available to me for the moment.

I am running a hp720 with hpux 8.07, VUE and X11R4 using Xt anbd Xaw.

What I did until now:
I initialized the X Intrinsics cxreating a top level widget with XtAppInitialize. I passed as a application_class name 'commandWidgetClass'.
Then I set the argument values for window height and width using XtSetArg and
passed it to the toplevel widget with XtSetValues.
When I call XtRealizeWidget, I get a window of the specified size, but I have no idea how I can draw something in it.

Can anybody send me some help and perhaps some basic information how to use the widgets ?
In which situation it is useful to use them and in which not ?

Thanks very much in advance

I would have appreciated an announcement of the policy change - 
Dartmouth will not be able to run xv 3.0, and I'm probably going

I also debate whether this, with the new ""institutions must pay""

You don't mention your platform but Digital has a custom widget, NetEd, 
which does exactly what you want to do. Cost is nominal 300 or so - call your
local office.  The widget is supported on a variety of platforms and I heard
rumblings of porting to Sun, etc. so it may be worth the check.

Hi! I've just installed the new XArchie 2.0.1 and it all works
fine, except:

on our grayscale xterm the custom icons compiled into the
program don't work at all, but on the BW terminal it works fine.
I can set the icon to an xbm file with .twmrc, but that doesn't
give the neat-o change when busy action. (Other programs with
similar actions, e.g. xmail, xbiff, work fine.)

The X-interface author, George Ferguson, suggests it might be a
problem with the X intrinsics, but isn't willing to hack around
to fix it himself. But I know zero about X programming, so I
don't think I can find it. 

Does anyone out there know an obvious fix for the problem?

     You  should  try  having  a  .xsession  script in $HOME to do these
things.  xdm will  start  up  your  process  using  the  system  version
(usually /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession), which should check whether you have

and edit it).

Our group is interested in using a 'pixmap' format for multi-colored
icons/buttons etc that is easily converted to and from other format from
'resource' files. Using pbmplus we can easily move to/from Xpm to our other
environments of MS-Windows and OS/2 PM :-(. We were wondering if Xpm or some
other format is under consideration to be used as a standard by the X
consortium for R6 as we would prefer to use whatever will be best supported by
X. 

Along the same subject line, is the reason the standard X pixmap is not used
because it doesn't have an associated colormap and other attributes? or is it
more involved? just wondering why there aren't editors for pixmaps out there
for the 'original' format.

Email replies preferred. Thanks in advance.

              Evolution of SCO newsgroups and Mailing Lists
              ---------------------------------------------
   
   Many readers enjoyed the opportunity to obtain and contribute useful
   information on SCO Open Desktop since 1990 through the ancestral USENET
   newsgroup sco.opendesktop or it's companion mailing list.  Similarly,
   there was a demonstrated need for an information and discussion forum
   for SCO products in general.
   
   With the increasing demand for accessibility and for additional SCO
   newsgroups, many current contributors including those who have been
   active in circulating SCO related newsgroups and mailing lists felt
   that the readership would be best served by creating a biz.sco.*
   hierarchy to improve propagation (and hence availability) worldwide.

   biz.sco.{opendesktop,general,announce} were newgrouped May 1, 1991 in
   accordance with accepted procedure within ""biz"".  Given the content,
   this change relocated the ""opendesktop"" newsgroup to a more proper place
   within the established usenet news hierarchy and adds the new ""announce""
   and ""general"" groups.  On Aug 1, 1991, the former ""sco-list@uunet.uu.net""
   became ""scogen"" in keeping with established biz.sco.* naming conventions.

   biz.sco.binaries and biz.sco.sources were newgrouped on June 1, 1992
   to respectively accommodate SCO Xenix, UNIX and OpenDesktop specific
   binaries and source code.  The binaries and sources news groups are
   moderated, with moderator and submissions information and policy
   outlined in the periodic imformational postings in those newsgroups.
   Respecting USENET etiquite, these newsgroups are _not_ gated to
   mailing lists, but are archived on several nuucp and ftp hosts.

   biz.sco.magazine was newgrouped Dec 14, 1992, to provide a discussion
   area for the readers, writers and publishers of SCO Magazine.
   
   Subject to the USENET NEWS hierarchies carried by your upstream feed,
   you are now able to subscribe to the following:
   
        Newsgroup                    mailing list subscription
        ---------                    -------------------------
        biz.sco.opendesktop          scoodt-request@xenitec.on.ca
        biz.sco.general              scogen-request@xenitec.on.ca
        biz.sco.announce             scoann-request@xenitec.on.ca
	biz.sco.sources			<none>
	biz.sco.binaries		<none>
	biz.sco.magazine	     scomag-request@xenitec.on.ca

   You are _strongly_ encouraged to obtain these newsgroups via USENET
   NEWS mechanisms vrs mail.  Anyone having difficulty arranging a news
   feed for these newsgroups is welcome to email the undersigned and
   I'll do my best to help.  We also offer all required software in
   source code form via anonymous FTP and UUCP, as do many archive sites.
   If, after having explored all options, you are still unable to receive
   biz.sco.* as news, you may subscribe to the mailing lists.
   
   The 4 discussion newsgroups are bi-directionally gated to companion
   mailing lists, so anyone not having access to NEWS but who does have a
   UUCP or Internet mail feed can still participate fully using email.
   Mailing list subscribers should send their request to the appropriate
   ""mailing list subscription"" address above, including in the message body:

	Add: subscriber_address		-eg-
	Add: your_logname@site.do.main  -or-
	Add: up!stream!yoursite!your_logname

   Inclusion of an alternative working bang-path relative to a well know
   major functional site might prove beneficial.  Deletions are handled
   the same way, simply substitute ""Delete:"" for ""Add:"", ensuring that
   you use the exact same address you subscribed with.  Mailing list
   subscribers receive ""how to post to the mlist"" article submission
   information when their request is processed.  If you don't receive
   an acknowledgement within a few days, check your routing and try a test
   message via xenitec.on.ca back to your host.  In such cases, it's likely
   that someone, somewhere, is bouncing mail replies to you (and would do
   the same with mailing list traffic), and you'll want to resolve your
   connectivity problem before trying to subscribe again.  Mailing list
   subscriptions are free, subject to whatever arrangements you may have
   with the site(s) feeding you.
   
   Should you receive no response or experience a sudden and prolonged
   drop to zero volume on one of the mailing lists, this indicates that we
   are no longer able to find a working route to your site.  We loose a
   handful of subscribers this way each month.  If this happens to you,
   please email us your known working bang-path relative to a major site.

   What's in the newsgroups (and mailing_lists where applicable):
   
   biz.sco.opendesktop: Technical questions and answers and informative
                        postings relating to past, present, and future
                        implementations of the SCO OpenDeskTop operating
                        environment and it's various bundled components.
   
   biz.sco.general:     Questions, answers and comments on SCO products
                        in general, and of course resulting discussions.
   
   biz.sco.announce:    SCO and SCO Developer product announcements of
			interest to current and future users of SCO products,
			and to SCO developers, resellers and distributors.
                        (moderated, followups directed to biz.sco.general).

   biz.sco.sources:	SysV or BSD source code for useful programs and
			utilities, modified to compile and run with various
			incarnations of SCO Xenix, UNIX, and/or OpenDesktop.

   biz.sco.binaries:	Binary packages compiled from SCO compatible source
			code, often from source posted in biz.sco.sources
			and often installable using the SCO ""custom"" utility.

   biz.sco.magazine:	Interaction between the SCO Magazine readers, 
			writers and publishers.

   You should always endeavour to post your article to the most applicable
   newsgroup.  For example, posting your ODT question to the ""general""
   newsgroup will preclude your question and answers to it from being
   saved in the public ODT archives.  Appropriate crossposting is allowed.

   namespace.  Suggestions for additional biz.sco.* newsgroups and/or
   mailing lists should be emailed to the address below.

I have written a server program which makes socket connections to many nodes
and collects data from that nodes periodically. I need to display this data on
my X Application. I tried
to invoke this server using XtAddAppTimeout which works ok. But the
problem here is some time there is delay in collecting data. So I doesn't
returns to EventLoop during that time and my application remains busy and
It doesn't respond to users input. I button press events are queued and
exected after server finished its task. Now I am going to try AppAddInput
call. So that It reads pipe only when there is something to read in pipe.

I am thinking of creating one pipe in which server will write and client
which is my X application will read. Now I have some doubts which you may
be able to clarify.

1) When I fork a process. It will create to copy of my process. Right !!
   Now what does this two copies mean? Two Shells. Where should I fork
   my application. What are the responsibilities of this processes. How
   should I call this processes.?

2) Can I fork more than one processes. So that I can read from more
   than one servers input.

Organization: Computing Laboratory, U of Newcastle upon Tyne, UK NE17RU
Lines: 89
NNTP-Posting-Host: enterpoop.mit.edu
To: xannounce@expo.lcs.mit.edu

I have placed a new release of my aXe editor in aXe-5.0.tar.Z on
export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1).

The significant change this time, and the justification for the hike
in the major version number, is:

  o undo has been implemented.

    By default only the last change can be undone, but a resource is
    provided to allow the user to specify how many, including unlimited,
    levels of undo information should be kept. Also, undo of undo is
    supported.

There is no truth in the rumour that the next version will be EmaXe 19 :-)

                          -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

For those who have not encountered aXe before here is a summary of
what it is all about:

aXe is a simple to use text editor for X that represents a significant
improvement over xedit. Also built around the Athena Text Widget it
features, amongst other things,

   o multiple windows
   o multiple buffers
   o default menu interface
   o optional button interface, with choice and layout of buttons 
     under user control
   o minibuffer for expert use and access to external filters
   o provision for defining a keyboard macro
   o geometry specification and resizing in terms of characters
   o file selection via a browser
   o knowledge of line numbers
   o parenthesis matching
   o regular expression searching
   o restricted or unlimited undo
   o ability to change font
   o easy entry of control codes
   o xterm-like keymap feature
   o easy runtime setting of selected preferences (resources)
   o both brief and comprehensive on-line help
   o server mode with cooperating client programs
   o optional extension language using Tcl
   o optional Xaw3d widget set compatability
   o collection of reusable widgets that embody the functionality of aXe

I have personally built and run core aXe, i.e. without the Tcl and
Xaw3d options, on the following systems:

   Sun SPARC        SunOS 4.1.x     MIT X11R5
   Sun SPARC        SunOS 5.1       MIT X11R5
   Encore Multimax  UMAX 4.3        MIT X11R5
   DEC 5000/120     ULTRIX 4.2      MIT X11R5
   HP 9000/710      HP-UX 8.07      MIT X11R5
   MAC IIci         AU/X 3.0        MIT X11R5
   
but not all have been subject to the same level of testing. I have
only tested the Tcl and Xaw3d options on the first.

A number of '#ifdef SYSV'-isms that have been fed back to me have been
incorporated into the code and a possible scandir replacement is
provided for those systems that do not have one.

Although aXe will probably build under R4 run-time problems have been
encountered in the past. I have not bothered to try this version under
R4, and have not put any effort into solving previously known
problems.  Therefore, if you are at R4 you very much take pot luck. If
it doesn't work the only alternative is to try the last release,
2.1.1, of version 2 which should still be around. It doesn't have as
many features and uses the Widget Creation Library (Wcl). Not only
that, it requires an old version of Wcl, 1.06 or 1.05. Version 3 of
aXe was nearing completion when version 2 of Wcl came out so aXe 2
never got converted to make use of it.

aXe is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12)
and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1) initially, and probably in due
course from several other ftp sites.  Check your nearest using
xarchie.

If you can't ftp, try sending email to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com with the
word ""help"" alone in your message body.  You will receive instructions
on how to ftp via email.

Hi,

    Does anyone know how to redirect the stdout and stderr of a program to
    a callback function in X ? The program does not fork() a child process
    so I guess I can't use pipes.

    Can anyone help ?

The *fastest* way is to use an X server with shared memory extension. It uses
shared memory if it is a local X server (hence images don't have to be duplicated),
and defaults to the regular image routines if either the shared mem extension
is not available, or if it's  not the localhost.

Organization: NeoSoft Communications Services -- (713) 684-5900
Lines: 24

Given that all the source code contains explicit permission to use or
modify the code without fee in addition to the shareware notice, I would
say that the shareware notice is unenforceable.  All you need to do is
make minor changes to create a derivative work which is explicitly allowed
under the first part of the copyright notice.  Of course, this would be
circumventing the author's wishes on the subject, but I'd say if you're
not going to pay him no matter what, you'd be on relatively safe ground
with that approach...  In fact, given the internal contradictions of the
copyright notices, I'd guess none of it could ever be enforced, but not being
a lawyer, I can't be positive.

Regardless, the fees he's asking are not excessive, and I would encourage
anyone who wants to use the program to pay them if at all possible.  Even
though it is unlikely that you have actual legal obligations to pay the
author, it would be reasonable to do so, to support his efforts if nothing
else.

Is there an ""official extension"" to X which allows the use of audio? Most
of the X audio programs use system-specific ways to access the audio

way to do this (like the video extension XV)? Thanks for any help.

     I recently found an excellent source for X-windows programs. I've seen
quite a few x-windows toolkits up there. The place is:  

                     export.lcs.mit.edu

go to the contrib directory. Its full of x-windows programs.

                                           Hope this Helps!

Xoftware from Age Software has proven good by me.  Runs under MS Windows and is relatively stable.

could probably help you out more.

   Here's a listing that I came accross a while ago.  This question seems to 
come up often enough that I figured this would be of interest.  Note that 
the server ""X Appeal"" for DOS is available in demo form on the internet via 
anonymous ftp.  This is one way of quickly checking out the feasability of 
using your system as an X server.  Enjoy!

This is a monthly guide of X servers that can be used on non-UNIX
networked machines to display X clients running on UNIX machines.  I
use the name UNIX loosely here.  I know others can run X.

The sources for this information come from many places:  the FAQ for
comp.windows.x, blurbs and info packets from the vendors, user manuals
for the products themselves, conversations with sales representatives,
personal experience, comp.windows.x articles, etc.

Please forward any corrections or updates to the above address.

I think your performance will depend upon the X server. 

I'm running Linux and XFree86 on a 33Mhz 486DX with 4MB of RAM (8MB swap) and
it runs just fine.  Its a lot better than some of the crappy old Xterminals
in the labs at school anyway.

You could probably outfit a 386SX with a minimal Linux/X setup for $900
and be better off than with an Xterminal. IMHO.

This would be tedious, but if you have the time you could get the .bdf
file (I can email it to you if you don't have it or don't have easy access 
to the X source), and could make your own bold font from this.  Since each
glyph is just a bitmap, you could write a program to convert each
glyph to a bitmap-readable file, use bitmap to make each glyph ""bold"", and
convert the results back to .bdf format.  Then, use ""bdftopcf"" to create
the .pcf file.  Then, stick the .pcf in /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc (or wherever)
and include it in fonts.dir and, voila, you'll have what you need!

I have a clone almost with no name generating 91k xstones on a 486/33Mhz

Excuse me, but with a 486/50 256k cache, S3 928 ISA card, 8Mb XS3 (X11R5) running 386bsd  you can get 100k+ xstones at 1024x768 65Mhz which I doubt 
that your XP10 series gets. Commerical verions X servers for S3 928 cards
can get 136k xstones. So the performance is there and additionally since
is running unix multiple users can use the system which I have done in
my home setup.

Maintenance is minimal if you can read README files for the X servers and
for 386bsd.

You allways could port and use emu from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/emu.tar.Z.
We've implemented a blinking text cursor for the very reasons people mentioned.
You can even configure the actual size of the text cursor (horizontal / ver-
tical line cursors, smaller block cursors), turn on and off blinking,
set the blink rate and so on. You even get blinking text - ok, enough
advertising.

I haven't looked at the xterm code in this respect, but from the memories
I have when we had to decide whether to start with xterm and make it do
what we wanted (mostly the blinking text), I'd say it won't be easy, since
xterm is a hairy mess (understandable if you follow it's roots back to
X10).

The actual task to get the cursor to blink isn't that difficult if you
provide the right hooks. As Antonio mentioned, you'll have to show the
cursor directly after it has moved, or people will become confused.
Since it's a good idea to take the cursor off the screen when you 
do anything on screen anyways, this isn't very complicated. You'll just
have to start the blink process with the cursor showing directly after
it's mapped.

As for the portability of emu and it's newest version. The one on export
is still the same as on the R5 contrib tape. We wanted to get out a new
release for over six months now, but unfortunately we're drowning in work.
But since the changes aren't affectiong emu's behavior much, I'd say
whoever wants to try emu shouldn't wait for a new version.

As is, emu won't work on BSD derived systems (e.g. SUNs) with anything else 
than a csh. There is a fix to this, which is very short (remove one line
of code). I'll put this on export today.

It's called PC-XWare.  It is based on NCD-Ware, their X-terminal
software (which , IMHO, is excellent).  PC-XWare will include
X-Remote and be optimized for 32 bit machines. It's X11R5 based.
It will support remote management, etc.

I need some advice regarding monitor to use with Xfree86. I have an ET4000
based graphic card with 1 Meg of memory. I know this card is supported in
Xfree86 because a friend of mine has one of these in his PC. His monitor is
17"" colour capable of displaying 1280x1024 resolution. I cant afford this kind
of expensive monitor. I heard from somewhere that Xfree86 requires multisync
monitor with minimum horizontal scan frequency of 60KHz. Is this true?
I would only like to use Xfree86 at resolution of 800x600 in 256 colours and
so was thinking of buying a cheap 14"" SVGA monitor. Interlaced (Cheap)14"" SVGA 
monitors only have have maximum horizontal scan frequency of about 38KHz.
Will this kind of monitor work with Xfree86? 

Please reply by email.

Thaks in advance.

After looking at the scaling code I realized the follwing:

  1) My problem with the resolution 100x100 foints is due to an installation 
     problem.

  2) That the X server or font server will rescale the best font it can find
     to meet your requirements.  

     This means that if you server return a response like the following

     -adobe-helvetica-medium-o-normal--0-0-75-75-p-0-iso8859-1

     You can ask for the follwogin:

        -adobe-helvetica-medium-o-normal--14-100-90-90-p-0-iso8859-1
 
     and it will generate it for you.  You should try to always use 
     known pixel sizes.

Due it seems to Sun's crapulous organisation of the X libraries and includes,
most standard (GNU and other) software won't compile out of the box (well, tar
file). 

Right now I'm trying to make ghostview. It complains it can't find X11/XaW/...
so I just linked (ln -s) the files from /usr/openwin/share/include/X11 and 
now the ghoddam thing _still_ complains it can't find them.

I still haven't been able to compile xdvi, not no way.

Has anyone _ever_ managed to get _anything_ normal to compile on a Sun
(SunOS 4.1.3 and OpenWindows 3)? What's the trick I'm missing? I've even 
tried hard copying all the relevant files into the ""right"" places and
every time, there's some bit missing or it refuses to find it.

I understood that there are two methods to connect application code to widgets:

                       callbacks and actions

The problem I face now is that I have a quite long piece of application code
that performs a lot of drawing into a window. I want to connect this to a
widget. No problem so far. I could use a callback function or an action to do this, processing any events afterwards.

But because the drawing takes some while, I want the application code sequence
to be able to be interrupted by events. Then I want to handle the events
and resume with processing the application code at the point it was
interrupted.
It seems to me that this isn't possible, but how can I give the user the
impression that his inputs are immediately processed ?

Has anybody an idea?

Please answer via e-mail.

Thanks in advance.

Subject: 'makedepend' problem
Organization: Information Resources Inc.
Lines: 46

Hi, netters:

We have a problem with 'makedepend': it doesn't know how to correctly process
#if clause in C preprocessor statements. It evaluates everything to
true no matter what the conditionals are.
For example, makedepend chokes on one of X11 include files (as distributed
by Sun) - namely Xos.h:

#if     !defined(SUNOS41) || defined(__STDC__)
#       include <string.h>
#       define  index   strchr
#       define  rindex  strrchr
#else   /* BSD && !__STDC__ */
#       include <strings.h>
#endif  /* !SUNOS41 || __STDC__ */

Here 'makedepend' evaluates both #if and corresponding #else statements
to 'true' and tries to open the file <strings.h> which doesn't exist
under Solaris2.
We also have a lot of #if statements in some of our legacy code.
We got and built 'makedepend' off the net - it didn't fix the problem.

In all fairness it should be noted that 'makdepend' man-page (Sun's
distribution) mentions this problem:

BUGS
     If you do not have  the  source  for  cpp,  the  Berkeley  C
     preprocessor, then makedepend will be compiled in such a way
     that all #if directives will evaluate to  ""true""  regardless
     of  their  actual  value.  This may cause the wrong #include
     directives to be evaluated.  Makedepend should  simply  have
     its own parser written for #if expressions.

Has anybody come up with some solution/fix to 'makdepend' other than
WriteYourOwnParser... and willing to share it with us?

Since we often experience delays in our newsfeed - please reply 
directly to my e-mail address -> I'll post a summary.

Thanks in advance.

removing all the other /dev/cg* , /dev/bw , and /dev/fb and then selectivly
recreating /dev/cgtwo0. Xsun comes up mono. recreating /dev/fb, comes up mono,

I've tried Xsun & Xsun -dev /dev/cgtwo0.

PS Xnews will come up in color but it's not statically linked, and the
dynamically linked Xsun comes up in mono also.

PPS Xsun was compiled on w/ gcc 2.3.3 on a system running 4.1.3 and the 4/110

	Well, I know of one hack to sort of do this conversion.  First
get ghostscript and check out the gs_2asc.ps file that comes with it.
It prints out some information about where each text string goes on the
page, and maintains page counts.  I've written a little C program to
massage the output of gs -dNODISPLAY gs_2asc.ps somewhat, so that you
can get all the ascii strings in the document.  No guarantees that it
won't break up words/sentences, though - I've used it with varying
degrees of success.  Anyways, try this out, it may do what you want.

/*

Many spreadsheets do regression analysis.  The topic is also well covered
in most undergraduate statistic books.  Cubic Splines are usually well
covered in any undergraduate computer science numerical analysis text.
I am sure ge/mm has a well stocked library.

I have never used mathematica, but I would be surprised if it could not do a

Are there any graphics texts with examples/demos/projects directly in
X?

The last time I taught the course, I used a popular graphics text that
uses its own graphics package, with implementations available for
X/Mac/PC.  The problem was that after the course the students were good
at programming in the artificial package, but frustrated that they
couldn't really use their skill for other work.

BadWindow is an X protocol error.  If you write a custom error handler
which does not do ""exit(1);"" the error handler will return and let
your program carry on.  So, using a XSetErrorHandler is the way to
go, but never mind the longjmp.

Hi all,

I've read the FAQ, I've fiddled around, but I am still having problems getting
my poor old HP9000/300 to let me input/display characters above 127.  I have 
the following in my .Xdefaults:

XTerm*Font     :   -adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--14-140-75-75-m-90-iso8859-1

So I believe that I have the correct font selected to use in xterm.  I have NOT
set my LC_CTYPE environment variable because whatever I put it, it tells me that
that locale is not supported (apparently we have no additional locales defined,
or at least, /lib/locale doesn't exist).  I can get some of the characters
above 127 to print out, but they are not where I'd expect them -- for example,
Alt-v does not produce a u umlaut.  This leads me to believe that the fault
lies with the stty settings, which are as follows:

speed 9600 baud; line = 0; susp <undef>; dsusp <undef>
intr = ^C; quit = ^\; erase = ^H; kill = ^K; swtch = ^@
eof = ^D; eol = ^@; min = 4; time = 0; stop = ^S; start = ^Q

	I got a few requests asking for a summary, so I'll attempt one
here:


	Here's the ones I know of:

	Wind/U		- Bristol Technologies

	Hunter SDK	- Hunter Systems

	MainWin		- MainSoft

	LIBWXM          - Visual Solutions


	Hunter 

	The company is going through some big changes.  I expect
to eventually see the Hunter SDK pop up with a new name.  At the moment, it
is difficult to get phone calls returned and otherwise obtain info.
Hopefully they will post something about themselves once things settle down. 

	Visual Solutions

	LIBWXM is a product that I just heard about.  They don't
yet support MDI or MFC.  Libwxm was used to port VisSim, a mathematical
modeling package.  Does native Motif Widgets, like Wind/U from Bristol.
Contact Carrie Lemieux at 508 392 0100 for more info.  She's very helpful.

	MainSoft

	This translates Windows source to a Unix executable that
can switch off between a Windows or Quasi-Motif look and feel at
runtime.  They skip the Xt and Xm (Motif) X toolkit levels and go
straight to Xlib.  They don't yet support MFC.  They're at 415 896 0708.

	Bristol

	This company that seems to be on the right track.  Wind/U uses
Xlib/Xt/Xm to give a *real* Motif app.  They seem to be doing the most work
in trying to support things like DDE, Common Dialogs, and more on the horizon.
My contact there is knowledgeable, responds to my email, and wrote an example
program for me showing how to obtain X widgets from Windows handles.
They're at 203 438 6969, or you can email info@bristol.com.

Subject: Resources and cpp - HELP!
Organization: FWI, University of Amsterdam
Lines: 35
NNTP-Posting-Host: ic.fwi.uva.nl

Hi,

I am running X11R4 on an IBM RS/6000 (AIX 3.2) and X11R5 on a Sun4 (SunOS 4.1).

Since I run X on both colour and black&white displays, I need different
values for the same resource, so I want to use #ifdef COLOR in my
application defaults files. However, cpp is only invoked by xrdb, and
not when the resources are loaded on demand.

Is there a proper solution to this?

So far, the only proper solution I've come to think of, is to create 2
different files in my ~/app-defaults/, say XTerm and XTerm-color, and
set my XFILESEARCHPATH to either $HOME/%T/%N or $HOME/%T/%N-color.
But that does not always seem to work (e.g. executing a remote shell
command without reading the .cshrc does not set XFILESEARCHPATH).

Furthermore, I thought of using #include ""XTerm"" in XTerm-color.
However, for resources in XTerm that I want to override in XTerm-color,
things are different on both machines. On a Sun, the FIRST found resource
is used (i.e. the one from XTerm, the b&w one), while on an RS/6000, the
LAST found value is used (i.e. the one from XTerm-color). What can I do
about it?

I have one last question: for the specification of XFILESEARCHPATH, I
can use %T, %N, %C and %S. %T stands for app-defaults, %N for the
resource class, but what do %C and %S stand for?

Thanks in advance for replying,
Marcel.

That are the authorisation files for the server.
Depending on what type of key your X supports they contain magic cookies,
DES based authentication or SUN DES authentication.

The place is defined with the DisplayManager.authDir 
Other things like the file name can be changed as well see XDM manual pages.

Bandwidth is unlikely to be the problem, except over a wet string network.
One of major flaws of X is the horrendous number of transactions (and
hence process switches) that it forces upon a host.  Actual measurements
(hourly average) are 5 per second per logged in user, which can lead to
20-50 or more process switches (depending on whether each event is
filtered by the window manager as well as the applications and how
many processes are needed for each character.)

While a blinking cursor needs only the application and the networking
process, and does not add any transactions, it will add something like
10 process switches per second per user.  This is a significant increase
in overhead, especially as the application may have quite a large working
set.  If you want a rapidly blinking cursor, there could be as many
as 50.

If you want to go there, I wouldn't start from here!

Bristol Technology announces the availability of 
its HyperHelp(tm) and Xprinter(tm) demo for downloading.

This demo showcases the two products in the form of a 
diagram editor called DE.

Download the demo and see some of these exciting features for yourself:

	 o Complete on-line context sensitive help system.

	 o Printing support for PCL5 and PostScript.

	 o Rotated Text support!

	 o Source code for the demo is provided.

The demo is available via anonymous ftp from ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9).

There are two versions of the demo located in the vendor/Bristol directory:
Sun     - sun4.demo.tar.Z (SunOS 4.x)
HP      - hp700.tar.Z     (HP-UX 8 & 9)

If you have any questions about the demo, send an
e-mail to: support@bristol.com.

If you want another version of the demo (rs6000,etc...) 
please send an e-mail to: info@bristol.com.

Remember to use binary mode!


What are HyperHelp and Xprinter?  Read on......
---------------------------------------------------------
Bristol Technology is proud to announce version 3.0 of
its popular HyperHelp product and version 2.0 of Xprinter.

			    HyperHelp 3.0
			    -------------
HyperHelp is the de-facto standard for on-line context
sensitive help in the Unix marketplace.  Through a one
line function call, application developers can access the
full features of HyperHelp and cut down drastically on
their development time.  HyperHelp can use the same RTF,
project, and bitmap files as the MS Windows Help facility.
This allows a documentation department to maintain a single
set of help documents portable between MS Windows, Motif and
Open Look.  HyperHelp can also be authored in FrameMaker. 
And with HyperHelp 3.0 Bristol introduces its SGML compiler!

New features in HyperHelp 3.0 include secondary windows,a character
based viewer, segmented bitmaps, SGML support, and an improved History
window.

			     Xprinter 2.0
			     ------------
Xprinter 2.0 allows developers to add sophisticated
printer support to their existing/new X based applications
very easily.  Xprinter uses the Xlib API for both the
display and printer.  This lets you use the exact same code
for drawing and printing.  Take a look at the source code for
our demo and see Xprinter in action.

If you are interested in adding PostScript and PCL5 support
to your application, Xprinter is the tool for you!  Earlier
this year Bristola dn USL signed an agreement that
resulted in Xprinter becoming the standard printing technology
for UNIX SVR4.2.


Feel free to run the demo and let us know what you think about
HyperHelp and Xprinter. 

If you have any questions or comments, send them to us at:
info@bristol.com or call us at (203) 438-6969.

				Happy demoing,

Subject: X11R5 vs X11R4 Configure Event Handling
Organization: UMIACS, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742
Lines: 31

REPOST:

I have two questions (well probably more...) about how Expose & Configure
events are handled.

I have an appl. which uses 1 window to draw in.  Since I give the user the
capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be
resized, I made a translation table for the Expose & Configure events.
The Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure event
calls my rescale method.  The rescale method invokes a ""fake"" Expose
event (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate Expose struct)
to draw the data.

Quest 1.
When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R4 (running in either R4 or R5 env.)
I get multiple (>4) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size
is changed.  I assume I'm getting cascading events.  Is that right?
Any suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way?

Quest 2.
When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R5 I get no Expose events
whatsoever.  Do events and/or translation tables act differently in R5?

Thanks in advance

One way to ""mask"" the left button check the contents of the XEvent that the
XAddEventHandler send to your event_handling function (in your case, it is the
show_mouse_position function. 

If the XEvent arrive in this function as 

XEvent p_event;

then, the value of p_event->xbutton.button is the button that was pressed. So, 
you just do a switch on that value in order to distinguish between them. In case
it was not clear p_event->xevent.button is an int. 

By the way, you mentioned the Button1MotionMask and if anyone can help me with 
these MotionMasks I would be grateful. I can not figure out how do distinguish
between motions by which button is pressed as the motion is occurring. In 
essence I would like an seperate event-handler for motion with each button. 
Unfortunately, the XEvent sent by a MotionMask does not seem to contain the 
value of the pressed button.

Any ideas,

Summary: Go ahead... swamp me.  <EEP!>

I'm not familiar at all with the format of these ""X-Face:"" thingies, but
after seeing them in some folks' headers, I've *got* to *see* them (and
maybe make one of my own)!

I've got ""dpg-view"" on my Linux box (which displays ""uncompressed X-Faces"")
and I've managed to compile [un]compface too... but now that I'm *looking*
for them, I can't seem to find any X-Face:'s in anyones news headers!  :-(

Could you, would you, please send me your ""X-Face:"" header?

I *know* I'll probably get a little swamped, but I can handle it.

	...I hope.

Subject: preventing user from hitting CTRL-ALT-BKSP to exit X
Organization: Open Networks, Inc., Reston, VA
Lines: 49

Hello,

	I am admin for an RS/6000 running AIX 3.2, X11R5, Motif, and xdt3.
	I want to prevent the user from hitting CNTL-ALT-BKSPC to exit X.
	
	I've tried invoking X with 'xinit -T', but that doesn't work.
	xinit appends the -T to the call to .xinitrc, and not to the
	call to X.  

	The man page to xinit is no help.  In fact, it tells
	me that xinit is a script when it is really a binary file.  

	So far, the only way I've been able to accomplish this feat is
	to add the -T to the call to X in /usr/lpp/X11/defaults/xserverrc.
	I would rather not do it this way.  Does anyone have any other ideas?

Subject: Glasgow RX - remote execution of X programs, Part01/01
Summary: Nice program to do remote xterms.
Keywords: perl X remote execution
Organization: Glasgow University Computing Science Dept.
Lines: 976

[[ I posted this a few weeks back, but all I got back was an error
   message ""pnews: /dev/null: Permission denied"".  Yep, /dev/null
   had a mode of 600.  (Arrghhh!!)  ]]

With renewed interest in ""setting the DISPLAY variable"", etc.. I
thought I would post my contribution.

This Perl script is my solution.  It trys to be intelligent about
what it's doing so that you should be able to type ""rx host.domain.etc"",
and get a xterm running on ""host.domain.etc"", with all the difficult
stuff taken care of.

In theory, this program can do *everything* you ever wanted to do
when you wanted to run a remote command in the background - it
doesn't even need to be an X program.  Try a ""rx big-machine make""
for instance, for a backgrounded make on the remote ""big-machine"".

For more details and a full list of features read the README file,
about 20 lines below...  All comments welcome.

Duncan.

X   Glasgow RX - remote execution of X programs.  Version 3.1.7
X
XCopyright 1992 Duncan Sinclair <sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk>
X
XTrivial to install, but there's an Imakefile to make it even more trivial.
X
XThe perl script needs some customisation before it is installed, just
Xedit the ""rx.pl"" file, and read the comments.  Once you've done
Xthis you can ""xmkmf"", then ""make install install.man"".
X
XFEATURES:
X
X*) Does the right thing for off-site remote execution.  Including
X   setting up $DISPLAY to include domain names, and passing
X   magic cookies, or doing the ""xhost"" stuff.
X
X*) Allow different remote user name.  (rx -l user host ...)
X
X*) Smart quoting of arguments - makes passing wild-cards easy.
X
X*) Custom command execution - link it to ""remacs"" to get a remote
X   emacs command.
X
X*) Automatic xterm options - names the xterm according to hostname,
X   and turns on ""login shell"".
X
X*) Default command is xterm.
X
X*) Propagates X-ish env. variables to remote session - user may
X   extend the list of variables to pass.
X
X*) Special handling for bourne shell users.
X
X*) Tries to do remote execution from same directory as local.
X   That is, it propagates $PWD, in an intelligent manner.
X
X*) Logs errors in a file.
X
X*) Overall Intelligence (TM) - makes reasoned decisions about what
X   you are trying to do, and tries to ""do the right thing"".
X
X*) Written in Perl, for portability and hackability.
X
XFor more info, read the man page or the source.

X.SH NAME
Xrx,rxterm,r* - remote command, xterm, anything execution
X.SH SYNOPSIS
X.B rx
X[
X.B \-l
X.I username
X]
X.I host
X[
X.I command
X]
X.br
X.B rxterm
X[
X.B \-l
X.I username
X]
X.I host
X[
X.IR args .\|.\|.
X]
X.SH DESCRIPTION
XThe 
X.B rx
Xprogram connect to the specified
X.I host
Xand executes the specified
X.I command
Xin the background, returning immediately.  To allow the execution
Xof X programs, it copies a number of environmental variables to
Xthe remote session.  If you omit
X.IR command ,
Xthen rx will start an xterm on the remote host.  The
X.B rxterm
Xvarient starts a remote xterm on a host, and also passes
X.I args
Xto the remote xterm as arguments.
X.PP
XShell metacharacters which are not quoted are interpreted on the local
Xmachine, while quoted metacharacters are interpreted on the remote
Xmachine.
X.PP
XIf the name of the file from which
X.B rx
Xis executed is anything other than ``rx,''
X.B rx
Xtakes this name, stripped on a leading ``r'' as the command
Xto run on the remote host, using any
X.I command
Xparameters as arguments for the remote command.
X.PP
XIf
X.B rx
Xthinks you are using
X.B xauth
Xbased X authorisation, and you are calling to a off-site host, or
Xto a different username, it will attempt to copy an authorization
Xkey to the remote account.  Otherwise it will try to use
X.B xhost(1)
Xto grant access to the remote host.
X.SH OPTIONS
X.TP
X.BI \-l "" username""
XUse
X.I username
Xas the remote username instead of your local username.  In the absence
Xof this option, the remote username is the same as your local username.
X
X.SH ENVIRONMENT
XIf set, the values of PATH, DISPLAY, XENVIRONMENT, XAPPLRESDIR,
XXFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, OPENWINHOME, LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
Xand XAUTHORITY are exported to the remote program, unless the
Xremote username is different, or the remote host is off-site, in which
Xcase only DISPLAY is exported, with in all cases any variables named in the
Xvariable RXENV.
X.PP
XThe DISPLAY variable is tweaked as appropriate, to contain as qualified
Xa hostname as is needed.
X.SH DIAGNOSTICS
X.TP
X.IB command "": don't recognise my name.""
X.B rx
Xcannot decode the name it has been called under.  In this case
Xit prints a warning message, and continues, as normal.
X.TP
X.B ""rx: usage: rx [-l username] hostname [args...]""
XThis means it could not decode the arguments given to it.
X.SH AUTHOR
XDuncan Sinclair <sinclair@dcs.glasgow.ac.uk>, July 1992
X.br
XOriginally based on a program with the same name from the
X.B gwm
Xdistribution.  To distinguish this ""rx"" from other programs
Xwith similar names, you should refer to this program as the
X.B Glasgow
X.BR rx .
X.SH ""SEE ALSO""
XX(1), rsh(1), xterm(1), xauth(1), xhost(1), gwm(1)
X.SH BUGS
X.B Rx
Xmakes a number of assumptions about the relationship between the
Xlocal user, and the remote one, depending on whether the remote
Xhost is onsite or not, and whether an alternative username was used
Xor not.
X.PP
XIn particular, if either the locally used shell, or the remotely
Xused shell is the standard Bourne Shell,
X.B sh(1)
Xthen strange things are more likely to happen.  Especially when 
Xit's only one of them.
X.PP
XSometimes quoting can get messed up.
X.PP
XIt's too easy to fool the smarts in
X.B rx
Xto make it believe something that is not true, and fail because of it.
X.PP
XWhen
X.B rx
Xuses
X.B xhost
Xto grant access, the
X.B xhost
Xcommand may fail silently.
X.PP
XIf
X.B rx
Xtries to send to large a command to the remote machine, it will
Xlikely fail with a parse error from csh.  If this happens, you
Xwill probably have to reduce the size of the exported environment.

X# remote execution of X programs.  Based on a script in an old version of gwm.
X#
X# To install, put rx in your bin and make rxterm a link to it.
X#  Some configuration will be necessary, see ""CONFIG"" comments...
X#
X# More and more this is less and less like the original....
X#
X# Major hacked to work for our(my) set up, and also partly
X#  re-written to work with sh, rather than ksh.
X#
X# Maybe I'll turn this into our first zsh script!
X#
X# Looks like it turned into a perl script at some point - big improvement.
X##############################################################################
X# This code tries to be intelligent in the way it works.  This means there
X#  are tons of implicit assumptions about the environment it is run in.
X#  These assumptions are all valid on the machines I use, and in my
X#  environment.  At the same time, I try to make as few assumptions as possible
X#  about the remote machine.  Here's a list of all the more tricky ones...
X# *) That the remote machine has csh.  (Linux?)
X# *) That $RSHELL = /bin/(k)?sh ==> remote shell = /bin/(k)?sh.  (Make same.)
X# *) If remote shell = sh, that $PATH is compatible.  (Use csh, etc..)
X# *) I pass a cookie to the remote machine if need be, but does it
X#    know what to do with a cookie. (eat it?)
X# *) There must be others...
X##############################################################################
X# Why am I using csh to run the remote commands?  Simply because it doesn't
X#  interact badly with rsh, and hang waiting for a file descriptor to
X#  be closed.  I'd rather use zsh, or bash, or even perl, but they are not
X#  as universal as csh.

That's not all it says.  The coverage of modifiers is in Chapter 8
of Volume Four (or chap 7 in older Athena editions), where there is about 
10 pages on how to specify translations to capture
various combinations of keys or buttons.

The Xlib route uses XLookupString and there is a lot of coverage
of how that works in Volume One,  chapter 9.  You should read this
to understand how all the mappings work before trying to do anything
complicated.

I am using xdm on X11R5 with OW3 and Xview3 on Sun3s and SPARCs running 
SunOS 4.1.1.  Prior to using xdm, I used to set PATH and other environment
variables (like MANPATH, HELPPATH, ARCH, etc) in my .login file.  With xdm,
the .login file doesn't get executed and therefore neither the olwm
root-window nor my applications know about these variables.

I used the ""DisplayManager._0.userPath"" resource in /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config
to succesfully pass the PATH variable.  But I am having problems passing anything else!!!  I tried execing $HOME/.login in /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession
but that didn't help.  I also tried using
	""DisplayManager.exportList: HELPPATH MANPATH ARCH""
which didn't work either.

I would appreciate any help on this matter.

Thanks in advance,
Shash

Subject: Action Translation Table implementation
Organization: Naval Ocean Systems Center, San Diego, CA
Distribution: usa
Lines: 51


Hello,


Our application requires us to capture keypad presses for all windows
in a number of applications.  We are trying to use action translation
tables to implement this.  We have only succeeded by assigning the
translation table to every individual widget in all windows in a single
application.  The Xt calls we make are included below.

It would be much more convenient if we could assign the translation
table to a class of widgets rather than individual widget instantiations,
and also accomplish it for MULTIPLE applications.  If someone could
describe how do this it would be greatly appreciated.

Platform: Sun Sparc w/ X11R4 & Motif 1.1.4

***********************************************************************

static XtActionsRec actionsTable[] = {
        {""up"", do_up},
        {""right"", do_right},
        {""middle"", do_middle},
        {""left"", do_left},
        {""down"", do_down},
	{""bye"", quit},
};

static char defaultTranslations[] = 
		""<Key>KP_8: up() \n\
		 <Key>KP_6: right() \n\
		 <Key>KP_5: middle() \n\
		 <Key>KP_4: left() \n\
		 <Key>KP_2: down() \n\
		 <Key>KP_1: bye()""; 

XtTranslations	trans_table, trans_table2;

(. . .)

    XtAddActions(actionsTable, XtNumber(actionsTable));
    trans_table = XtParseTranslationTable(defaultTranslations);

    widget = XtCreateManagedWidget(""msg"", xmPushButtonWidgetClass,
		form, wargs, n);

    XtOverrideTranslations(widget, trans_table);

Subject: Efficient PC Clients
Organization: System Constructs, Inc
Lines: 27

We're looking at various X11 clients for PC's and we're looking for some
information about the relative efficiency of different products.  Are any
notably efficient (fast)?  Are any notably inefficient?  I assume that a
Graphics Accelerator makes them significantly faster (right now I'm looking
at ico running on Xoftware/32 for Windows sitting on the Distinct TCP/IP
platform, and it's (not surprisingly) much slower than ico running on the
Sparc10's console.  What are the key ways of improving performance for
PC (presumably Windows) clients?

Also, what about async solutions?  (Yes, I appreciate that it will be 
*much* slower even with V.42bis.)  I'm in the process of installing PPP
(with header compression).  How does that compare to cslip?  I've seen
a product called XRemote by NCD that promises to be pretty efficient, but
are there comparable products out there?  If we're looking for efficiency
for async, PC clients, what should we be looking at in addition to standard
PPP w/ compression and XRemote?

Any information would be greatly appreciated.  I'm still taking in all
the information in the faq, but any tips about the relative efficiency
of various product offerings would be great.  (I get the impression
that discussions about speed are largely application specific, but
that not withstanding, any comments would be appreciated.)  Thanks.

Computer Equipment Garage Sale:

I've finally decided to clean out my closets and get rid of some of the stuff
that is broken or not being used by me.  I've put together a list and
indicated what I think each item is worth.  This is just my estimate, and I
am very open to any offers, including trades.  I'm currently looking for
some CD-ROMs that will work with a Mac CD ROM player CD Caddies, HD floppy 
disks, any used Macintosh software, a 387-33Mhz Co-Processor, or basically 
anything you have lying around (cans of soup, the neighbor's cat, etc...)  
Make me an offer, no offer will be overlooked... 
I really want to get rid of this stuff...

Ok, Here's the list:

52 Meg 3.5"" SCSI Hard Drive.  Conner Model #CP-3150.  I bought this from a guy
	at a swap meet to use with my Macintosh.  Unfortunately, I can't seem 
	to get it to work with the SCSI controller in my computer.  The
	guy tested it with his PC, and printed out a copy of the Norton Disk 
	Doctor report which says it has no bad sectors. (I'll send you a copy) 
	I was dumb enough not to get his phone number, so I can't return it to 
	him. The drive has many jumpers on it, (which I don't know how to set) 
	so maybe that's the problem.  I was quite disappointed that it didn't
	work so I'm trying to minimize my losses.	~$45

52 Meg 3.5"" SCSI Hard Drive. Conner Model #CP-3150.  Same situation as above.
	I bought both of these drives from the same guy.  Despite the different
	model numbers they are the same exact drive.  Same report from NDD
	(I have one for each drive) will be included.	~$45

40 Meg SONY 3.5"" SCSI Hard Drive.  SONY Model #SRD2040A.  The drive mechanism 
	is completely trashed.  This hard drive was in my computer (Mac SE) and
	had a stiction problem.  Well, repeated banging on the side of the
	computer resulted in a head crash (yes, metal scraping metal) which
	was not too pleasant to listen to.  Still the SCSI controller
	card is in good working order, and can be used for parts, or a 
	project.	~$20

65 Meg Seagate 5.25"" HH SCSI Hard Drive.  Model #ST-277N.  I originally bought
	this drive, because it had a small stiction problem, and I though that
	I could fix it.  Well I determined that the drive mechanism was fine,
	and that it was a controller problem.  (motor controller wasn't sending
	proper signals.)  Well, after taking the controller off the drive, 
	looking at it, and putting it back together, I realized that I
	accidentally severed one of the small flat cables that connect the 
	drive to the controller.  I tried to solder it, but I'm not that good
	at soldering so I couldn't do it.  Worked perfectly before I messed
	up.  I used it as a temporary drive when the SONY (above) crashed on
	me.  Also loaded the drive with about twenty Mac applications,
	worth well over $1000.  (Claris CAD, MS Word 5.0, Think C,
	Excel, and many others) 
	I think all it needs is a resoldering of that cable.  You also get all
	the software on the drive. (if you can accept being a pirate)  I only 
	ask that you delete my data files from the drive.  I was really angry
	when I broke that connection, and then couldn't fix it.  I just don't 
	have time to play with it any more.	~$65

AT&T ISDN 7500 Modem.  This is for use on digital phone systems.  If you know
	what this is or would like technical information on it, let me know.  I
	have some tech documents on it.  Is supposed to be the same thing as an
	AT&T digital phone, but without the phone part.  It seems to be in  
	working order (passes self test perfectly OK).  I have no idea how 
	this is worth...   Let me know if you're interested.

Motorola 68881 CoProcessor.  I haven't tested this one out yet, but if anyone 
	is interested I will get it tested out, to make sure that it works.  I
	had trouble using it with my accelerator board, but then I spoke to the
	manufacturer of the board and found out it couldn't be used without 
	another controller chip.  When I was looking around to buy one new, the
	prices were around $100.  I will guarantee this to work.	~$65

I've sold stuff like this before, and it was a huge success, with many 
satisfied people trading or bartering stuff they didn't need anymore.  I 
usually ship through the U.S. Postal Service (haven't had any problems yet) 
and the shipping costs will be split or negotiated.

Well, that's all folks.  As I said before, no offer will be refused.  If you 
can convince me to give OCit to you instead of throwing it out, TRY!  I hate
to throw away stuff...

I have had a Nikon L35AW since 1988. Unfortunately it is no longer
made. It is a P & S sealed to resist water to a depth of 12 feet. It
is not really an underwater camera but it has been great in wet and
dusty conditions. It takes AA batteries (hooray). It has the solid,
heavy feel of old-style Nikons and has taken all the abuse I have
been able to give it. This includes a lot of water (rain, river and
sea), desert and beach sand as well as being used as a weapon
against a mugger. Shouting and swinging the camera by the strap
didn't scare the mugger away, hitting him with the flying camera
did. This is my, ""never be without a camera"" camera. The current
water-resistant (Sport Touch I think is the name) model is nothing
like as solid or well sealed.

Recently I got a case of Hot Shots '93 cards.  Unfortunately I had
not planned on keeping all of them.  I sort of got stuck with the
case.  (I'm not going to mention any names, though.)

So, I am trying to sell off most or all (minus a set for myself).

If you have any interest in a set, a box, or any singles, please let
me know.

The set has 250 cards.  Each card features a great looking woman in
various stages of dress.  Some nude, semi-nude, lingerie, dressed.
99 percent are gorgeous, I feel.

There are 4 subsets:

Girl, Girl, Girls   1 through 9
Promo cards   251 through 259 (also numbered 1 of 9 through 9 of 9)
Emperor's All-Stars   269 through 277
Stripping Empress   260 through 268

Also, I am supposed to be getting some holograms soon as well.

Oh, and lastly, I have a very few error cards and a few cards
that were originally intended to be used as card #1, but the
company changed their mind.  None of these cards are easy to get.

Anyway, if you have some interest in any of these cards, please
drop me a line, as I am most eager to sell a bunch off.

Oh, and if you are interested, I also have 1 set of Hot Shots '92
left, and about 2 sets of California Dreaming cards as well.

And lastly, I have promo cards for all of the cards I have
mentioned, and holograms as well.  Not a lot, though.

It's basement cleaning time.  This stuff has got to go.

I have two boxes of 9 track 2400' tapes, around 20 tapes/box.  They are
free to anyone who wants to come by and pick them up.  They've seen
very little use.  If anyone wants these bad enough to ship, they're yours
for the cost of shipping, the cod charge and a $10 nusiance fee.

I have a lot of serial cables.  I have all kinds, ribbon, shielded, long,
short M-M, M-F whatever you want.  Most appear to work well with PC serial
ports, but I will not gaurantee that.  Tell me what you want and I'll do
the best I can to match.  1.50 ea or 10/$10.  Shipping included.  No CODs
under $20.  (You want to pay a $5 COD charge for a $1.50 cable?  Go buy
the cable at your local computer store instead, it'll be cheaper.)  I believe
these cables were removed from service at a computer center.  They appear
to be in good condition and the ones I have used have worked well.

I also have a 15 KVA Exide UPS with batteries that needs minor repair, probably
a logic board.  It weighs about 280 pounds and is 36 inches high.  I think
they used to run a Prime system off of it.  Best offer over $75, but you 
need to come pick it up.  Use this to run your house from your solar panels.

I will consider reasonable offers on any of this stuff.

  Sorry for any confusion I may have created.  The disk did come out of
a VS2000 and I would like to use it in a IBM PC clone.  The reason that I
posted to comp.sys.3b1 was because I saw the drive (XT2190) mentioned

A very good R&B group came out in 1988 called the Pasadenas.  I bought their
cassette single and fell in love with it.  I've tried to find their LP
or CD but have had no success whatsoever.  Just wondering whether anyone
out in Netland had heard of them....

their song that hit the charts was called Tribute...

""traction control"" as far as the optional feature that one buys with
cars is not the same thing at all as a torque sensing differential.

a torque sensing differential is a type of LSD, but not all LSD's
are torque sensing.  viscous coupled differentials (as opposed to
viscous couplings) are rotational sensing, not torque sensing.
for that matter, so are ""traction control"" systems that use ABS
sensors and pulse braking.

This is a tricky situation; if the previous owner didn't inform
the dealer of the odometer change, then the previous owner committed
fraud, and he may be liable. The dealer may also be liable; If the
previous owner notified the dealer, or if the previous owner had the 
dash replaced at a dealer, or if the previous owner had the dash changed 
legally, any records search on the car should turn up the fact that
the odometer had been altered.  If a dealer changes the speedometer, he has
to report it (it goes into the car's service record with the manufacturer,
and on the title, if I remember correctly; the dealer told me that
the old mileage, etc. were sent to Ford when my T-Bird's speedo 
was replaced). If the odometer can be set to the old mileage, it must 
be; if it can't (eg, electrically-driven odometers) then the mileage 
of the old odometer must be written on a permanent sticker which is 
affixed to the door frame of the vehicle. 

Either way, if the change had been done legally, then a records search
(which the dealer almost certainly did) should have turned it up.

Call your state's Department of Transportation/Public Safety/Motor
Vehicles--or your tag agent--to find out for certain what your
rights are. Your state's Attorney General will know for certain ;-)

Rich,
	First of all you might want to join the VetteNet (vettes@chiller.compaq
	.com)  during your search/acquisition of the 67.  $20k sounds about 
	right for a wrong engine, condition 3 car.  This means that the car may
	not have significant investment value but could be an excellent driver
	and or hobby car.  You will also want to get a copy of the Corvette
	Black Book immediately.  Don't leave home (to look at Vettes) without it.
	Since you are contemplating spending >$20k, you might want to invest a
	few hours in reading the ""Corvette Buyer's Guide"" and purchase Noland
	Adams' tape ""How to Buy a Corvette.""  The tape shows you how to check
	for damage, etc..  There are many many factors that will affect the
	value, road worthiness, and repair expense of your proposed 67.  The
	list is much too long to go into here.  Join the VetteNet where
	there are over 100 current Corvette owners (many with 60s vintage
	vettes) that are available to help you.  The pubs I mentioned above
	are available from Mid-America Designs (800) 637-5533 and several

- Plan your gas stops in major-city areas to avoid the 25 cent-per-gallon
""only gas station for 50 miles and you're an out-of-towner"" surcharge.

- Prepare your car.  Don't forget things like your fuel & air filters.  If
you're loading your car up, consider putting your spare on TOP of your stuff
just in case of a flat.  In my x-country trip, a tire disintegrated in the
California desert & it took me 20 minutes to unload all my stuff to get to
the tire.

- If you have a hatchback, cover all your stuff with a white bedsheet to help
keep the stuff and your car cool, as well as *possibly* avoiding theft.

- McDonalds have good, clean bathrooms.

- invest in a $30 CB & magnetic roof antenna.  It may help if you're stranded,
and you can always ask people for places to stop for food, etc.

- Many times police like to hang out in the 1st 10 miles after you enter a
new state, to catch all the speeders who have ""escaped"" the previous state.

- Same as above; when you enter a 55mph city zone after hours and hours of
65mph rural interstate

Not alone at all. My old 83 Accord (now in the hands of a sibling) has a much
better engagement of the clutch. Even the old 84 Civic we keep as a beater 
feels better in this aspect. Note that these are cars with 250,000 kms and
140,000 kms respectively. My 90 Prelude blows both of them away in every 
respect except smooth clutch engagement. Of course the Kawasaki is the best
of the bunch but I need more than 2 wheels most of the time.

The Prelude has had a dud clutch from day 1, and after three years and 67,000
kms is no better. Best of luck and feel free to add this to your collection.

i am 99.99% sure that subaru (and porsche) use the boxer configuration
and not the inline 4 crank that you analyzed and compared. would you
care to re-evaluate the other case of a flat four?  i think that this
configuration is perfectly balanced as far as primary, secondary
forces and couples are concerned.  i have an article in front of me
that says so.

the flat four is also shorter than an inline 4, so even if it is mounted
longitudinally it will not take up lots of length.. and a longitudinal
placement is easier for a 4 wheel drive drivetrain.

i think that subaru's ads hold water.  in practice, their flat fours
are noticeably smoother than inline 4s and completely buzz free,
though some may not like its peculiar note.  but as alfa has shown, a
boxer four can produce a spine tingling scream that only the likes of
recent hondas can approach.

i think you got it the other way round: the Ferrari flat 12 is a 180
degree v12 and not a ""true"" boxer, while the subaru and porsche are
true boxers.  don't know about the vw bug though, but i suspect that

Eliot is right about 2.2 liter engine in the second (and last) generation
MR2's. But the original guy did not indicate the year of his MR2. If it's a
first generation car (like my '85), it has 1.6 liter engine (or perhaps
same engine with a supercharger, if it's '87 -'89).
The sound he describes is common to any older Toyota engine I ever heard.
I don't know the relevance of his observations about oil changes, my simply
makes noise. Not all that annoying, mind you. But you hear it well when the
engine is right behind your left ear :-)

The GT was based on the Kadette chassis. It was built model years 1969-1973.
The Manta came out in the 1974 model year and was a 4 seat coupe.

This is a very simplistic view of safety. Assuming that you are in a collision
(less likely with a more agile smaller car), then the important factor
is how well does the car sacrifice itself to save you. This is why a thousand
pound F1 car can hit a wall at 200 and the driver walks out and why
everybody dies when a Suburban hits a wall at 35 (as I recall for the last
generation Suburban HIC numbers). 

As an aside, just what is the point of an airbag? It seems to me that
seatbelts with pretensioners (Audi et al), or a good tight 5 point belt 
will prevent you every moving far enough to hit the airbag. You might be

saved from some flyign glass? Or is an airbag just a lowest common denominator
safety device that is of some use in a head on collision when you are
wearing no seat belt?

You guys are correct.  The Bricklin was produced in Canada.
The National Museum of Science and Technology here in Ottawa
has one, and sometimes they put it on display.  Most of the time,
it stays in storage because the museum doesn't have much room.
It's a big deal for a car to be Canadian and that's why they 
have it.  If anybody's a fan, they also have a nice green '73
Riviera that looks like it just came out of the showroom.

In 1972, they lowered the engine compression so that it would run on
regular gas (not to mention the addition of emission controls).  The '72 
also added pop-out rear quarter windows...

Alot of parts are available for the GT from C & R Small Cars in CT and
used from Bill Daley's Opel Parts in MA....

Review of 1989 Ford Taurus SHO -- By Gene Kim
=============================================

Background:

    Last week, I bought a 1989 Ford Taurus SHO, moving up from driving
a 1987 Toyota Celica ST and a 1975 Oldsmobile Cutlass.  I have been
interested in buying a SHO for about five months and have been combing
the classifieds in Denver and Chicago every week.  I bought a
remarkably clean maroon/red SHO with 92K miles on it for $6800.
As far as I can tell, this is about $2000 under Blue Book and I still
have another 8000 miles before the Extended Service Plan runs out.

    As one should with any pre-1991 SHOs, I made sure that the car was
already refit with the upgraded clutch and pressure plate, as well as
having been recalled for upgraded rotors and seatbelt attachments.
However, my SHO does not have the newer rod shifter -- I understand I
can get this for $230 from any Ford service center.  In addition, the
car received the full tune-up at 60K miles, receiving new platinum
plugs and valve adjustment.

    For a car with 92K miles on it, the car was virtually immaculate.
The clearcoat paint job was devoid of any large chips or dents,
although the front air-dam/molding was covered with lots of small
scratches -- not surprising since most of the miles were spent on the
highway.

    Having driven a smaller two-door coupe for so long, I was a bit
concerned about whether I could get used to driving a larger car.  To
my surprise, the size of the car doesn't bother me at all -- it seems
just as nimble as my Celica!  (No comparisons with my Oldsmobile.  :-)
Visibility from the driver's seat is excellent, helped mostly by of
the small the quarter-windows, aft of the back-seat door windows and
in front of the C-pillar and rear window.  Parallel parking is a bit
more difficult, but other than that, I love the size.

    In fact, I'm starting to appreciate the large trunk as I pack up
for a 14-hour drive to Washington, DC for the summer.  More on the
ride later in this review.


Engine:
    
    As with anyone even slightly interested in SHOs, I was very
interested in the 24-valve 3.0L Yamaha ""Shogun"" engine.  I was not
disappointed.  Base performance of the engine under 4000 rpms is
good.  You can even do reasonable launches from second gear, although
I don't make a practice of this.  The engine revs smoothly and eagerly
-- tooling around town does not require many shifts.  This is good
since the shifter is definitely one of the weakest points of the car.
(More on this later.)

    While the performance of the engine under 4000 rpms may be
unremarkable, it undergoes a Jekyll/Hyde transformation once you hit
higher revs.  At 4500 rpms, a butterfly valve opens and you can
literally hear and feel the geometry of the engine changing as twelve
more valves open up.  The engine soars to its 7000 rpm redline, and
you are treated to, in my opinion, the sweetest sounding V6 around.
The engine inexplicably sounds OVERJOYED to be at 6500 rpm!

    I've noticed that when I drive around town, I constantly watch the
tach to see how far below 4000 rpm I am.  To go from 2000 rpm to 4000,
you may have to punch the accelerator -- while torque is more than
adequate, it doesn't come fully online until those other 12 valves
are used.


Transmission:

    When _Car and Driver_ first reviewed the car in 1988, they
marvelled at how Ford had put such a wimpy clutch and balky shifter
into the car.  I remember driving a friend's parent's SHO in 1990, and
remember thinking about whether I had the leg strength to drive the
car in traffic -- the clutch was that stiff.  That was back then.

    The entire clutch assembly on my SHO has been replaced under a
Ford recall in 1991.  The clutch on the SHO feels no stiffer than the
one on my Toyota Celica.  In fact, the friction point seems a bit
larger and more forgiving.

    When playing with the shifter with the car parked, the shifter
felt very reasonable.  The 1-2 and 3-4 gates were where you'd expect
it to be, and the shifting action was smooth.  On the road, it's
much the same -- but you have to shift SLOWLY!  Make no mistake, it's
a clumsy shifter.

    When hurrying shifts, like when I was initially trying to impress
friends, I consistently miss the 1-2 shift, often grope clumsily for
the 2-3 shift, and sometimes even muff the 3-4 shift.  I find this
pretty amazing in a car like this.

    It also took me several days to realize that you get the smoothest
shifts when you take your time.  Seems obvious, but compared to my
Toyota and my friend's Honda, this seems atrocious and clumsy.
Someone on rec.autos noted that CRXs should blow SHOs off-the-line
because of the incredibly clumsy shifter.

    I now shift much more sedately, and the shifter seems more
reasonable.  When you play within these bounds, the shifter works
smoothly with no surprises.  I don't know whether the rod shifter
upgrade would help at all.

    Along these same lines, I initially had trouble shifting gears
smoothly.  Again, slowing down the shifts and taking more care to
match revs when letting out the clutch helped immensely.  This took
several days for me to get the hang of.  (I think some of my problems
were because I've never had a car with enough power to balk at bad
shifts in higher gears.)

    Occasionally, I have trouble shifting into reverse.  The shifter
refuses to enter the gate, and I often grind the synchros trying to 
get it into gear.  I'll be watching this carefully in the next couple
of months.

    A quirk:  When I upshift and the engine drops back to 1000-2500
rpm, I hear a whirring and then a grinding noise coming from the the
engine compartment.  Not terribly loud, but the passenger can
definitely hear it.  I asked about it when I was looking at the car,
as do all my passengers.  Apparently, this is a definitely a ""SHO
sound"" and is the gearbox -- apparently called ""gear rollover"".
Replies to my queries on rec.autos are at the end of this review.


Exterior:

    As I mentioned before, I am astounded by how well the body of this
SHO has stood up.  Paint chipping on the front bumper and grille are
virtually non-existent.  Looking at how older Tauri sometimes
don't age so gracefully, I wonder what the guys at Ford did
differently to the SHO bodies.

    The body, in my opinion, is extremely attractive with matching
color body moldings than the stock Tauri.  For some odd reason, the
SHO seems different enough from vanilla Tauri to get stares at
stoplights -- of course, this could be my overactive imagination.
:-)  SHOs get fog lights, a more open grille, a completely
monochromatic exterior, and a deeper ground skirt in the back with
""SHO"" stenciled in relief.  I've seen a couple SHOs whose owners have
colored these in with florescent colors or in black.  Yuck.

    I don't think the car is flashy.  I like it that way.  I feel
almost anonymous with all those Tauri out there, but different and
distinctive enough to those of us who care.  :-)


Interior:

    The interior is what really makes me feel like I don't deserve the
car.  The seats are grey leather, the steering wheel and shifter are
covered with black leather, and the entire instrument panel is done in
a black/grey/metallic scheme.  

    The instrumentation is stock Taurus, except for the 140 mph speedo
and 8000 rpm tach.  You get a center console with two cupholders, a
large compartment under the radio (great for a CD player), an armrest
that contains yet another compartment, three appropriately sized coin
holders for tollways (I think), and a compartment for holding
cassette tapes.  There's map-holders in the doors, and an oddly small
glove compartment.

    I spilled a whole can of Coke in the cupholder and was delighted
to find that the entire rubber holder can be removed and washed in a
sink.  Hey, I'm really impressed with the ergonomics and
thoughtfulness that went into its design.  And it's a 1989, before the
interior was upgraded!

    The backseat is bigger than any car I've had.  Why do they need so
much space?  :-)  (No smart-ass comments, please.  :-)

    The driver and passenger seat have lumbar and side bolsters.  From
what I hear, it's not uncommon for the side bolsters to show wear.
Mine is no exception.  The left side bolster on the driver's has
cracked and I'm not convinced the right bolster is inflating all the
way.

    A big surprise for me:  I forgot that SHOs don't have a normal
hand parking brake.  Instead, they have the regular parking brake that
you press with your left foot.  Too bad.  Again, I'm getting used to
it, but it seems a bit anachronistic to me.


Ride:

    The suspension is nice and stiff.  Too stiff?  It's stiffer than
any car I've had.  A friend's new 1993 Toyota Celica ST seems tauter
and is still able to soak up bumps better.  The SHO seems stiffer with
less ability to soak up bumps.  Driving over railroad tracks is a
noisy and jarring affair.  On the other hand, taking turns feels
wonderful because the body is so rigid and doesn't flex at all -- I
listened for that before I bought the car.

    On the highway, the ride is great.  When I drove the car from
Chicago back to Purdue, I had trouble keeping under 85 mph, let alone
from trying to see what 100 mph really feels like.  It's a relatively
quiet ride, but the sunroof rattles.  I've tried to find out what
exactly makes all the noise up there, but it seems to be the window
that rests on the rails.  No easy way to get rid of it, I think.

    Over the past three days, I've oscillated between thinking the
suspension is wonderful and perfect and thinking that the ride is way
too rough.  (Not for me, mind you.  But I wonder whether I would
advise my dad to buy one for himself.)  But, I've discovered, as with
the shifter, if you take your time with shifts, you'll have no reason
to complain.  Let me explain...

    The ride is worst when turning and applying lots of power to the
wheels.  I feel the wheels scrabbling for traction and torque steer
making the car skitter left and right.  After I understood this, I
avoid the limits of traction -- and I'm a happy camper again.

    It's not body rigidity, but the composure of the car.

    As if matching the suspension, the steering feel is quite heavy.
My first impression of driving my SHO was how hard you had to turn the
wheel at highway speeds.  It tracks straight as an arrow, but when
driving around a parking lot, the high-effort steering didn't seem so
useful.  However, it's reasonable, but it doesn't communicate the road
to the driver as well as a 1993 Ford Probe GT.  IMHO, it's much better
than the steering on my Celica ST.

    I wonder how bad this car is during winter?


Miscellaneous notes:

    GRIPES:

    The rattles from the sunroof is intermittent -- some days it rattles
        loudly, other days I look up wondering where all the noise went.

    Activating the sunroof is sometimes very noisy -- loud squealing as
	it retracts on its rails.  I wonder if there is a quick fix for this.
	Again, other days it completely disappears.  (Function of humidity?)

    Once I made the connection between the sometimes awful feeling suspension
	and torque steer, I've never complained about ride.

    I wish the seats had more support under the thighs.  Also, I wish the
	side bolsters would close more tightly.  

    I hear that tires for this car can get really expensive.  I
	currently have Goodyear GT+4s that cost the previous owner $500
	for four.

    I used to hate the Ford stereo systems -- whose idea was it
	to use a volume *paddle*?  Now, to my amazement, I don't
	really mind...  and sometimes think it's an okay idea!!!
	Pretty ridiculous, though.

    Getting up to 4000 rpm sometimes seems to be a chore.  But,
	this is no big deal.  There is more than enough torque
	down low.

    I often goof up the shifting when driving with friends.  It
	took me a couple of days before I could really shift
	smoothly from 2nd to 3rd gear.  (Hard to believe, isn't it?)

    My car has almost 93,000 miles on it.  My parents noted that
	it is almost impossible to find a low-mileage SHO. 
	Astute observation, IMHO.  I wonder how long I can make
	my SHO last -- I just bought a book titled ""Drive It Forever""
	for tips in this department.  :-)

    The goofy parking brake pedal still throws me for a loop.  I once
	parked the car in gear, and then accidentally let out the clutch
	after I started it.  The car jolted forward, and bounced off
	the car in front of me -- no paint damage at all, but starting the car 
	is a whole new ritual for me with that fangled pedal!  Also, I began 
	to wonder how strong that brake really is.  (Today, I backed out of 
	parking spot today and started to drive away before I noticed 
	the glowing brake light.  Oops.)

    The driver's power window creaks when closed all the way.  The same
    	thing happens in my parents 1989 Mercury Sable.  Oddly, all the
	other windows work smoothly.


    LIKES:

    I'm liking the interior amenities more and more each day.  The
    	cupholders are great.

    I didn't expect to use the keyless entry buttons so much, but
	it really is handy.  You can lock all the doors by
	pressing the 7/8 and 9/10 buttons together!  Neat!  And
	you can never lock yourself out of the car.

    I really feel like I don't deserve this car.  I really can't
	believe that I could afford it.  I got this car ten years 
	ahead of schedule.  :-)

    I love this car so much that I've been telling my parents to
	look into buying one.  I love this car so much that I
	wrote this 13K file -- I meant to write a couple of lines
	and ended up with this.  

    If there were a J.D. Powers Survey for used car owners, I would have
	an opportunity to express my incredible satisfaction of owning this 
	car.  I don't like thinking about getting another car, but at this
	point in time, I'm sure I'd buy another SHO.  For under $7000, you
	can't beat it.  (Next time with an airbag and ABS, though.)

    Insurance-wise, this car is also a big win.  I pay the same premiums
	as on my 1987 Toyota Celica -- despite that it has nearly twice
	the horsepower.  



Other Odds and Ends:

    Much to my amazement, there is no SHO mailing list anywhere.
Maybe because the _SHO Registry_ publication has filled this void.  I
haven't joined yet, but I've noticed that queries about SHOs still
appear on rec.autos about once a month.  Owners of SHOs are always
quick to respond, and are very vocal fans of the cars.  (Maybe some
of the most vocal on rec.autos.  :-)

    I've put together the responses to my questions about the cars, as
well as other posts with useful information on these cars.  I'll be 
posting this in the form of a FAQ soon.  

    If anyone is interested in starting a mailing list, please speak up!

Drivel.  I received delivery of my '93 Trans Am 7 weeks after I 
ordered (promised 6-8 weeks), and paid $400 over dealer invoice, 
which is a $1425 discount off of MSRP.  I only have about 370 
miles on it, but so far no problems, and it seems very well put 
together.  By the way, first year production will be about 60,000 
cars.  Dealers would like you to think there is a shortage, but 
considering they only sold about 90,000 F bodies last year and the 
new model was introduced mid-year, that is not going to create a 
shortage.  GM planning on ramping to about 160,000 F bodies next 
year (according to a WSJ article).
 
Several people have mentioned seeing a photo of the '94 Mustang in 
Popular Mechanics.  I saw a photo of it in Motor Trend January 
1993 issue (p30).  Direct side on view.  Although they described 
it as a ""seriously handsome car with broad shoulders,"" I thought 
it looked pretty boring in that view.  Roofline reminded me of a 
Toyota Celica (yuch!).  Description of mechanicals same as has 
been reported from the PM article.

Japan is _much_ more open than Korea.

Yes.  A Pontiac Grand Am suffers a factor of _2_ increase in price
when it is exported to Japan.

However, a Dodge vehicle (the one that Congressman Gephardt mentioned)
suffers a factor of _4_ increase in price when it is exported to Korea.
A Ford Taurus suffers the same problem.  A Honda Accord costs--I am

Now, now, before we get too carried away here....

Keep in mind that owning any car in Korea is a luxury that only the ruling
class can afford.  Every government agency worth its salt finds some reason
to levy a tax on car ownership; last I heard, there were seven different
fees to pay to own a car.  I believe this is the sort of petty bureaucratic
inefficiency that new President Kim Young Sam wants to eradicate.  Basically,
I think the rules came into place as bureaucrats from plebian backgrounds
wanted to wreak revenge on the ruling class.  In exchange, zaibatsu's like
Hyundai screwed over smaller companies, perpetuating a vicious cycle.
I have faith that Korean people can potentially build cars as well as anyone
else, but for now Hyundai cars seem to reflect the tensions within society,
of screwy components that won't work together.  Stubborn like a mule, the
car either won't go forward or won't stop at all.

I would be interested in knowing how reliable these cars are, how expensive
they are to own and operate (parts, maintenance, gas, insurance), if the
dealers are good, and if they actually live up to their economy image.

Another question:  what would I expect to pay for a Civic EX coupe with

I have a few questions about the TAX on  a used car purchase.
I live in New York State, and I am going to buy a used car.
I know that I will have to pay tax when I go to register the car.
But I would like to know of tax is payed on the book value of the car, or
on the purchase price.  Also, what tax rate is used ?  The owner lives in
Albany (8% tax), and I will be living in Saratoga with 7% tax.  
Do I pay Albany tax or Saratoga tax ?  (the difference is a whole $50)
One more thing, how much does it cost for the usual 2 year registration ?

Did I leave anything out ? What else might I have to know to purchase and
register a used car ?  (I've never done this before.)

The DeLorean had the yucky PRV V6 engine. A joint-venture between Peugout (note

junk with approx 140hp. Doesn't like revs at all.

If you look at the DeLorean in the movie Back To the Future you will note
that they changed the engine sound to a big V8. A real DeLorean doesn't sounds
half as good. You will also note that every time they have to spin the tires
in the movie the ground is all wet. This is because a DeLorean can't make
a burnout on a dry road! The weak engine thats mounted over the rear axle
makes it almost impossible.

My son is considering the purchase of a 71 MGB, which has been substantially
restored.  The odometer has rolled over, but we can't be sure of the actual
mileage.  The engine and drive train apparently weren't touched in the
restoration, except for a new carb and a few hoses.  He plans to do vacuum and
compression checks to see what they might tell us about the engine.  The body
and undercarriage have no visible rust, the interior is new, as are tires,
front brakes (not sure about the back), battery, bumpers and other misc parts.
The paint is checked in a few places, and scuffed here and there, allegedly by
a wind-blown car cover.  It seemed to handle OK, except for soft front shocks.
Questions:

Are there problem areas common to MGBs we should check out?

The brakes seem soft and rather ineffective; what should we expect in the way
of braking action?

It seemed to be ""doggy"" when accelerating from a stop.  What should we expect
it to do, given the 4-cylinder engine?

The top is in place, but will not reach a number of the snaps.  The weather
was cold.  Should the vinyl stretch and fit when it warms up, or is it forever
shrunk?

Is it normal for the wire wheels to be painted, or are they usually chromed?

Given this rather limited description, what would be a reasonable price?

Gee, this turned out to be a little long--sorry.  While my brother once owned
an XK120 Jag (what a car!) we're obviously not into sports cars.  Any help with
these questions, or suggestions on other things to investigate would surely be
appreciated.

Limited Tort Option will lower your rates. If you choose it, you can't
sue others for pain & suffering, but you still can sue for economic loss.
So you can sue for your wrecked car and for medical bills, but you can't
sue for $1000000 for pain and suffering.

At least, that's how I understand it.

There is a tool available to reset the service indicator on BMWs but the lights

of no other tool.... anyone else? 

About changing oil every 15,000 miles.... thats ok.... on newer Audis, they 
only require it after every 12,000 miles (I am talking about an oil change)
Just a query: do you drive your car VERY VERY carefully? Like no sudden 
acceleration etc? If yeah, then the 15,000 M oil change seems quite reasonable.
But if you drive kinda fast... I'd get a bit up tight abot that 15,000 thingy

Germans are just more organised; you can't blitz all of Europe in a

Just to clear things up (as to why I posted the question that way)...
I was debating with a co-worker about diesels.  I claimed they were
cleaner-burning than gas engines.  He said the extra ""junk"" put out by them
was offset by the savings in greenhouse gasses.   I made all the SAME claims
you did.  But, one question of his was what about the carbon?  I said it
was harmless, but he wanted to know how to get rid of it.  I suggested
scrubbers.  (I figured it would be no harder or more expensive to install
than ""cats"".)  Does there exist any designs for a scrubber?  (I'd like
to know just to answer his final question.)  I convinced him that diesels
are cleaner otherwise.

BTW, (I named my subject ""Dirty Diesels"" because I knew it would get a reaction
out of people who knew they were cleaner than gas engines and that they'd

    I don't remember the formula's off hand as it has been awhile since
I took aerodynamics and haven't used the stuff since. 
The Cd is related to the drag force which is what effects top speed and
fuel consumption. When the drag force on the car or aircraft is greater
than what the vehicle's engine can overcome it has reached its top speed.
(autos of course also have to overcome rolling resistance)
Since drag opposes the vehicle's motion, the engine must make up for that
by burning more fuel. Anyway, since the geometery of an auto is rather
complex, the Drag,pressure coeffiecent,etc is either found experimentaly, or
using a numerical method.

anyway for flow around a cylinder the drag coeff is:

            Cd = d/(q*2R)

       where d is the drag force, q the flow velocity and R is the radius
of the clyinder.
   To get a rough (very rough) estimate, you can set R at 1/2 the car's
width, q at the car's speed and knowing the Cd, find the drag force that
the car would need to overcome.

Don't worry about this -- they'll drop you like a hot potato after you do
  make a claim. They'll just make filing the claim a pain, but it will end
  when they leave you in the lurch.

>>>I've read in this group that Geico has funded the purchasing of radar

More than that. GEICO funded the company that developed LIDAR. When locals 
  showed a reluctance to BUY the units, GEICO started giving them away. I
  know they've given units to the Florida Highway Patrol, County Sheriff's a
  and some local governments.
The real question is why? This is the hook. GEICO, and other Ins. Co.s can
  tell which drivers represent risk. This is a determination they can make
  AFTER YOU receive a speeding ticket from one of GEICO's LIDAR units. Most
  drivers do not represent increased risk even after a ticket or two, but 
  this gives them the opportunity to RAISE RATES FOR EQUAL RISK. It's called
  extra profits. They also know how silly the NSL is, and how it is almost
  universally ignored. Driving in excess of the NSL gets you a ticket, an
  increase in your rates, points on your license --- but it doesn't make you
  a riskier driver to insure.
Like the sound of this? Like the people who thought up the scheme? Go GEICO!

Unless you have some driving history problems, you're usually better to go
with one of the major companies and stay there. You'll get long term customer
discounts on your premiums. Now, about the % of your premium that is paid as
commission. That's another story for another day.

I have this same alarm installed in my Syclone.  It works great.  The shock
sensor is very sensitive, but much more practical than the motion sensor I have
on my other car.  It doesn't trigger if the car is rocked gently by the wind,
but any kind of shock sets it off.  Even kicking the tire sets it off.  It

The shock sensor is adjustable and there are two cycles on it.  You can adjust
it to be sensitive enough that there is no way you could open the hood without
setting off the alarm.  Although, I know that you cannot pop the hood on the
Syclone without setting off my alarm now, and yet I have had zero (none!) false
alarms with this system.  The alarm tells you when you disarm it whether it has
been activated in your absence.  I have been able to trace every alarm to it's
cause and it was not a false alarm.

I guess it would be possible depending on the vehicle.  My Syclone is so tight
in the engine compartment that it would be tough to do this.  There are
supplemental power supplies you can put on with this Viper alarm, but I don't
have one.  I really think that if someone wants my car that bad, the alarm
won't keep them from it, even with a supplemental power supply.

This is primarily for convertibles.  I have a convertible and have looked at
this feature in detail.  Alpine actually makes a better radar unit if you want
to get one of these.  It has zones in it that can be shut down independently so
that if one side of your car has pedestrian traffic or something else that
would trigger an alarm, it shuts down the zone, or rather, pulls it in tighter.
I don't see the real benefit to these unless you have a convertible that you
leave the top down on.

Avoid the voice alarm that can be added to the radar package.  It talks to
people as they walk by.  I saw one installed on a Lotus Esprit.  The kids would
taunt it seeing how close they could get before it 'warned' them to get back. 
The owner finally disabled it, which defeats the purpose in my mind.
> 
> I'm interested in the opinions of you netters about these problems

> 
I am real happy with my Viper.  One other feature I really like is you can tune
it to your preferences.  You can have it arm passively or not.  You can disable
the chirp for arming/disarming.  You can have it lock/unlock the doors when the
alarm is armed/disarmed.  

I like these features.  I hate the chirp when the alarm arms/disarms, so mine
flashes the lights only.  I like the door lock feature, although I have to be
careful to take my keys with me because it doesn't know if you have left your
keys in the car when it passively arms and locks the doors.  But, if you are
meticulous about taking your keys with you, it takes care of the rest.

I looked seriously at the Alpine system too.  It is a real nice system, but
more money and it has a motion sensor standard instead of the shock sensor. 
The shock sensor is better....and the Viper shock sensor is better (2 cycle)
than the optional Alpine one, IMHO.  I think the Viper gives you a lot of good
value for the money.  But it isn't absolutely tamperproof.  No system is. 
Except maybe the one that James Bond had on his Lotus in For Your Eyes Only.

Primarily milage.  Gas is much more expensive, so people are very
concerned about it taking a few more liters per kilometer.  This,
along with narrow old cities, also results in smaller cars with
smaller engines.  These engines usually don't have the torque to mesh
well with an automatic.  So, having engines that don't work well with
autos, and a great concern for milage, the usual Euro-car has a
manual.

(Note that not many big Benzes come with manuals.  If you've got the
money for the car, you've got the money for the gas, and the engine to
drive through the slushbox.)

As automatics become more efficient, the ""bigotry"" is probably
reduced.  Still, everyone knows how to drive a manual, and cars are
cheaper with one, and it saves a little expensive fuel.  So there
aren't compelling reasons to go automatic.

There is no comparison for handling, reliability, or overall quality of

the point that they are trying to make is that while everybody settles

which is unique in that market segment.  and porsche also uses a flat

their engine is as good as a porsche's.. they are simply pointing out

If your Viper system were tuned like a neighbor's is you wouldn't get

up.

We all used to try to ignore the alarm, but have now made a pact to
bombard the house with night-time visits and phone calls when ever we
are awakened because some thunder storm passed over the next county
or a stray dog looked at the car.

Car alarms are a serious pain-in-the-ass!

 I don't think that a transmission fluid change will solve your problem.
 Unless you are in an extremely cold climate and using a very heavy weight
 fluid.  Follow the manufacturer's recommended oil weight.  Some of the
 cars I have had (all standard transmissions 4 or 5 speeds) recommend
 changing the transmission fluid at 30,000 miles under normal driving
 conditions.  I've gone 100,000 without changing the transmission oil (and
 had to replace the transmission bearings!). My older cars used 85 weight
 oil whereas my 92 Honda uses 10-30 motor oil (or maybe 30 weight).

One more way, which works in manual trans cars I've driven, and it is my
personal favorite (the other suggestions above are great, but try this
one, too).  

While pushing the shifter *gently* towards reverse, let the clutch out
slowly (right to the friction point) and the shifter will be pulled into
position. If you do it right, the car won't jump backward, nor will the
gears grind.... You will just glide back.

Some GT-40s are street legal, some aren't.

>>This car was right hand drive (weren't they all like that?). How much does
>>a GT-40 go for? How many were made?

I found my Shelby-American guide. There were a grand total 126 GT-40s
built:
		GT-40 Coupes		55
		GT-40 Road Cars		31
		GT-40 Mk II		13
		GT-40 Mk IIIs		 7
		GT-40 Roadsters		 5
		Mirages			 3
		GT-40 Mk IVs		12
		   	TOTAL:	       126
		Additional uncompleted Mk IIIs	6-12

Twelve of these cars were prototypes; 48 racing coupes; 31 road coupes;
eight Mk II coupes; 4 LHD Mk IIIs; and 3 RHD Mk IIIs. The other 
breakdowns follow the above list (eg, 12 were Mk IVs). The LHD/RHD
breakdown is only given on the Mk IIIs.

The prices (for those which can be bought) are around the $1 Million
mark, last I heard, with a projection of some $3.5 Million (or
thereabouts) in 2000. It was second only to some penny-ante Ferarri ;-).

Shelby won the FIA World Manufacturer's Cup with his Cobras in '65; that
was also the year that he retired them from the Shelby-American racing
team (in favor of the Ford GT program the next year). That victory
broke a 13(?) year Ferarri winning streak.

Well, there's lotsa info I could spout, but I'll refrain. Much of
this information comes from ""Hot Rod"" magazine's ""Shelby American
Cobra/Mustang Guide,"" which has more info on the Shelby-American 
Fords than you could _ever_ want to know.

I still can't understand all the hype about the Impalla SS, it STILL has
the ugly Caprice body (Orca on wheels).  The Caprice was the worst new
body style to come out of Detroit EVER! Now just because the LT1 engine
and a few suspension tweeks are being added.

Its STILL UGLY, its STILL a BARGE.  GM's answer to everything is ""throw in
a V8 and someone will buy it.""  Or ""add some plastic ground affects
and a few stickers and call it a GT, GTZ or SS, and someone will buy it.""

IMHO GM needs to scrap the Caprice body COMPLETELY and start over with a
BLANK sheet of paper.  No minor modification (wheel well treatments, tail
amp modification, or nose re-design or even the LT1 engine) will help
the existing Caprice.

re: extended Ka bands.

I recently bought a 2 band detector.  You guys must all think I'm
nuts, right?  Well, I did a little research into Ka usage in this
area and found out that Ka is not currently being used in this state
as well as surrounding states.  Here's how I found out:

- A cop friend who did spend time nailing speeders doesn't even know 
  what Ka is.  He's heard of K, which is what they use here and I
  explained that Ka is used for photo radar etc.. He then said, yeah,
  ""Ka stands for K automatic""... duuhh.  He then went on to say that
  plans were being made for getting laser guns as far as going high
  tech were concerned, but he didn't know too much.

- My 8 year old 2 band whistler was consistently going off at speed traps,
  even the real sneaky ones.

- When I called the Escort Shop, they confirmed that Ka is not used here
  or in surrounding states.  They did claim that Laser was being used
  a lot here, which I was quite skeptical of.

So in the end, instead of spending a lot of money and/or waiting
months for a state of the art detector, I got a low priced, high
performance 2 band Escort 2200.  Incidentally its performance is equal
to their top of the line model in X and K band detection.  I know that
Escort has been surpassed by other brands lately, but I've never fully
relied on a detector and I was convinced that the Escorts would be at
least quite good, which was good enough for me and my wallet.

wrong!  the GS300 and SC300 use straight sixes, while the ES300 uses a
V6.  only a giant like toyota can afford to have both a V6 and inline
6 in its lineup, but that won't last for long.

I'll pick up that PM and have a look -- maybe the picture in there is not
the actual car, but a prototype?

I saw the Mach III and was not all that impressed -- it looked WAY too
Japanese for me... the tear drop headlights reminded me of a Nissan NX...

Glad I didn't hold out for the '94 and bought a '93.  Maybe they'll work on
the design a little bit, listen to consumers and come out with nice-looking
'95 or '96.  It always takes a while to work out the kinks in a new design,
e.g. the F-body Camaro/Firebirds (btw, the new Camaros look like shit too).

Geico has purchased radar guns in several states, I know they have done
it here in CT.

I have also heard horror stories about people that have been insured by Geico
for years and then had 1 accident and were immediately dropped.  And once
you've been dropped by any insruance company you become labled a high
risk, and end up forking out 3 or 4 times what you should be for insurance.

My suggestion, stay where you are, or shop around but STAY AWAY from Geico!

I want to thank all the people that responded to my post
a few weeks ago about buying an '86 Chev Nova with over
100,000 mi.

I decided to buy the car and have had it for about a month.
I replaced the front brake pads and changed the oil.  So far
no problems have surfaced.

I received many suggestions and encouragement on this
purchase and figured a late ""thank you"" was better than none.

Thanks to all!

And here's my two cents:

The best convertible for the money, IMO, is the Miata. Yes, it's small, but
you're buying it as a second car, I hope, so you don't need the cargo room
of a big car. It's got enough power for fun, it's RWD like a sports car
ought to be (I'm gonna regret that :-{) and the top, while manual, operates
like a dream. 30 seconds and one hand to lower, and not much longer to raise.

The targa-type cars are nice, but they're not real convertibles.

Diesels fall into the same emissions mythology as alcohol fuels.  The main reason
they are considered ""cleaner"" is because they are better at the emissions we
actually measure and regulate.  But they also contribute additional emissions
which have long been determined to be as harmful, but no suitable control or
limits have been defined.  

Current evidence is pointing to most visible smog actually being diesel emissions
and suspended particles and less of a photo-chemical reaction.  Diesel particulates
are now becoming a major concern in decreased lung capacity.  And alcohols emit
signifcantly more aldehydes (a known carcinigen) than gasoline.  The evidence
is mounting that while we have been beating the gasoline engine to death, we may
have been ignoring the effects of the alternatives.

And anyone who thinks diesels are so great, should go and spend a few hours in
rush hour traffic in some cities in Europe.  There the stench of the diesels is
awful and it can even burn the eyes.  

Diesels being clean is only relative to our current standards.

I have tested both vehicles (identically
equipped), both for week-long periods.
Curiously (and consider these are test
vehicles), I found the Mercury higher
in build quality than the Nissan.

Either choice is good, but beware that
I did not experience reasonable mileage
with the V6.  Average city driving was
<15mpg, with about 21 avg. on the highway.

Both were optioned to the hilt (the Nissan
had leather!).  The Villager was in the
$24K range and the Nissan was over $26K.

Either I've just fallen for this, or you guys
are _really_ paranoid!

You're actually worried about somebody stealing 
your oil?

C'mon, you think a vandal'll do that?!

That's absolutely ridiculous!

Besides, how hard is it to get under the car to 
change the oil?

I can say from experience on the cars that I've driven and
changed the oil on, my Mazda 323 is pretty much a pain, but
once you've done it once, you don't forget how, and it
gets easier.

I can't imagine any other cars are much worse than mine.

I don't have any written data but I know what I have experienced.  I use  
S-50 in everything including my lawnmowers.  In my car it smoothed the idle
and reduced the operating temp by 5 degrees.  I havent used it long enough 
to test for wear, but some people I know have.   
 A farmer that lives near by used to have to overhaul his big deisel tractors
at least every other year if not every year.  Since he has been using S-50
he has went 5 years without an overhaul.

Also a friend at a machine shop has in the past rebuilt engines with 200K
miles on them because the coustomer thought it was time.  These coustomers
had ran S-50 since almost new.  It was found when measuring the internals
of the engine that they showed only about the amount of wear that would be
expected of 30K miles not 200K.

In my opinion it works.

I just bought an Altima (and like it very much) and yes there is a

In fact my first clue that this was a Stanza was that the owners manual

""IF"" I were the vandal, and I really hated someone, maybe someone who knew

Subject: Hawk GT new seat review
Keywords: Corbin
Lines: 30

Unable to stand the pain anymore, my wife bought the Corbin Gunfighter
and Lady with Passenger Backrest for my Hawk GT.

It came with no instructions, but it came 2 weeks earlier than they
said it would.  Installation would have been very easy, but the seat
fastening hardware was apparently always on the wrong sides with
the stock seat!  It never was easy to put on.  Once I figured that
out, the new seat went on the first try.  The passenger backrest, though,
does not fit as I thought it might.  The supplied screw to set the 
backrest angle does not fit, and I have not yet found a suitable, 
hard, ( SAE grade 8, or perhaps 5 ) 1/4-20 bolt that fits.  There is a
a soft bolt in there now -- just don't lean back.

The driver's section of the seat is a bit wider.  Seems comfortable
enough, but then again I put about 5000 miles on the stock seat
without a thought.  The passenger's section has about 8 times the 
volume of foam that the stock seat has, and from my short test it
seems much more comfortable.  The backrest helps a bit, but I've not 
has enough time to really test it.  The backrest also comes with a 
small pocket.  Its now more difficult to swing my leg up over the 
10"" taller seat.

If I go on the three-notch ride soon ( Dixville, Pinkham & Smugglers),
I'll give a more complete report, but in general it seems like an
improvement.

I just got a K75 and had the heated grips installed.  As far as I can
tell the grips look and feel the same as the standard grips. 
They are *not* soft.  Last weekend I did a 500 mile round-trip and
got to a point where it was in the 30s and raining.  Those heated
grips were *great*.  I've only had the bike a month and the heated
grips are already one of my favorite features on the bike.

Being related to former trainers, I have come to know that humans do have all the
advantages (well, at least one anyway). It is a little known fact that a dog will
involuntarily regurgitate and release an object that is too large to swallow. I
was told that if I were ever attacked by a dog I should ball my hand in a fist and
force it down the dog's throat. The dog would naturally gag and release, and become
momentarily disoriented. This commonly happens to humans when we go to a doctor and
have our throats examined ( Proof Positive ). In the time during the dog's
disorientation, the next move would be to wrap an arm about the dog throat in a 
choke hold manner and constrict with all your might until the dog lapses into
unconsciousness ( from lack of oxygen and halting blood flow ). Finally, run like
the wind to get away from the local area should the dog get up again and be really
pissed.

OOOOOOOpsssss. For a second there I thought I was in rec.beatthelivingcrapoutofadog

I was privelged enough to experience my first Volvo attack this weekend.

I was last in a line of traffic that was about 6 vehicles long, riding
down Rt. 40 in Groton Ma.  At the side of the road, sitting off on the
shoulder was the killer Volvo in question.  No brake lights, no turn signal,
nothing.  We were doing about 40 mph and I was following the cage in front
of me about 2.5-3 sec. back.  Well, as said cage passes the Volvo, the
Brain Dead Idiot (tm) behind the wheel decides that she doesn't need to wait
for me to pass also and turns out perpendicular across both lanes of traffic
so that she can turn around...  So I get on the brakes in a effort to not
T-bone it, and the horn in an effort to wake the BDI up.  As she finishes
the turn, she looks up at me with a completely blank, uncomprehending
stare.

Where can I get rocket launchers for the VFR?

Subject: Two Beemer Questions (R80GS)
Organization: Lunar & Planetary Laboratory, Tucson AZ.
Lines: 44

Hello Folks,

I'm very happy with my ""new"" R80GS.  My range is 238 miles on 4.8 gallons...
that's 50 mpg!!  Surprisingly, the bike is a real cruiser.  I was expecting
something rough.   She's a sweet backroad honey.  And I can go pretty much
anyplace I'd take my mountain bike.  As far as shaft effect, it's more a 
torque effect from the crankshaft in my opinion.  Rev it sitting still
(when the driveshaft is not moving) and the bike twists a bit.  Maybe
I don't ride her fast enough to get a shaft effect, but in my opinion
a little buffeting by wind is of far greater consequence.  Okay, here are 
my questions:

1) Any recommendations for a home-made fairing?  I'd like to keep the
wind off my chest, and perhaps my helmet, for comfort at highway speeds
(70 mph), yet don't want to (a) screw up the stability or (b) block my
vision too much for trail riding.  Anybody have luck with two-piece 
detachible fairings?  I'd like to make it myself out of plexiglas.

2) I run two lights, the standard headlamp plus a sidelamp mounted on the
crash bar.  The illumination's excellent that way, with a full beam coming
out from the level of the motor (left side); the lamp beam is linear so
that you get a bright streak of illumination from left to right, and it 
really picks up the periphery (deer lurking, etc.)  Combined with the 
headlamp on high you can see like day.  But I've heard that BMW alternators
don't crank out too much.  Do I need to shut down the sidelamp when I'm
puttering around in the dirt at low RPM?  

3) This is embarassing: I'm having trouble starting the bike first thing
in the morning.  I invariably flood the carbs, then go in and read a section
of the paper, and then she starts right up.  Is this a Zen thing? 

4) The Hayne's manual says do not under any circumstances use gasoline
with alcohol additives... Yeah, right.  What do you folks due to keep
the engine and carbs from being eaten by ethanol and methanol?  Any 
particular brands of gas that are best?  Additives?

Thanks,

OK, for the record, Spike is jointly owned. The registration says -or-

attention, I'd been half heartedly lusting after an SR500 for years. I
had successfully avioded buying it by rationalizing that I didn't need

Watch it buddy! Both of those are fine rides! Beth loves riding

	Yep! I did one yesterday on my shaftie Vision... I should mention  
that I had a pillon that helped rotate the bike over :-) . The wheelie was  
the result of a necessarily agressive acceleration manouver through an  
intersection (damn San Antonio cagers tend to be REALLY bad drivers).  

	However, I have done one by myself, it just takes a lot of  
pre-clutch dump rev action.

Well, as many a bored bike tourer can tell you, the way to steer
sans hans is to push your body off to the side you want to lean.
Say you want to turn left.  You push your body off to the left.
To do this, you have to push against something, and the only
thing to push against is the ground (through the bike).  Well,
the apple guy (Wozniak? or was that Churchill?) says that the 
ground will push you right back.  So, you pushed yourself off to 
the left by pushing on the ground to the right, and the ground 
pushed back toward the left.  Well, that push is on both wheels.  
The rear wheel doesn't care (unless you have serious bearing 
problems) (except of course on the Spagthorpe Dragonfly, which
had the revolutionary countersteering-contra-shaft-drive rear end), 
but the front wheel has trail.  If the ground pushes the front wheel 
toward the left at the contact patch, the trail will cause the 
wheel to turn to the right.  Hey, there we are.  No-hands counter-
steering.

Good point, I'd overlooked that. The Eclipse has a 3 point mount, 1 at
the rear and 2 at the front, and it's very stable on the FJ. I have seen
some with harnesses that mount to the sides of the tank, and that would
be a real problem on the FJ.

Be careful that you do not have any weight of the helmet resting on the
mirror.  It will depress the foam liner in the helmet.  That is not the
kind of foam that bounces back, like foam rubber.  Its purpose in life
is to absorb energy in an impact as it is compressed by your noggin.
If your mirror compresses it, there is that much less energy absorbing
capacity left to cushon your noggin in a crash.

I found the right handlebar to be a good spot, if on the sidestand.
Hang with the chinbar facing up, balanced across the grip and brake
lever such that the weight of the helmet doesn't compress any of the
chinbar foam.  This is more challanging with an open face helmet.

Black ones look better.  None are truely indiginous to America,

you never seem have enough of it.  Volvos hit them.  Only idiots
intentionally rear up the front half off the ground just to look cool.

Countersteering is a method for *leaning* the bike.  Another method is
leaning.  Once leaned, the bike turns all by itself.

Well maintained chains, running in oil, without those little rubber 'O' rings 
to cause frictional losses, might reach 99% efficiency.  The average open to 
the dust 'O' ring motorcycle chain probably has a difficult job making 90% 
efficient.

Another tip is to make sure you keep well to one side of the lane. This gives
you a quicker escape route.

I hate to pick on someone who may have been seriously injured (let's hope

Actually, a WERA racer, William Lumsden, considered running a Vmax in 
A Superstock.  He took it out to Talladega GPR for a practice day, and
_really_ annoyed the 600 riders -- they usually got caught behind a 
sideways Vmax in the corners, and if they passed him going in, he'd
blow by down the straight (usually wobbling).  Needless to say, since
he was 2 seconds faster on a 1977 CB400F, he decided against the Vmax.

Too bad.

 Grr. Hate the bastard who picked the weather for today.
 
 Went up to visit a friend overnight (about 45 minute ride).. rode up after 
work, only minor drizzing for the last 5 minutes of the ride... rest of the 
ride was very zen.
 
 Got up this morning, needed to go home and get some disks & stuff to work 
on her computers with, rainy as all hell. Soaked and cold by the time I got 
home.
 
 Since I didn't have another set of thermals which were dry, I said ""to heck 
with it"" and drove my cage back up.
 
 Lo and Behold, those funny blue clouds were up in the sky and this warm 
yellow thing I haven't seen in quite awhile showed up when I was 10 minutes 
into the trip.
 
 And me in my cage. Oh JOY.
 
 
 Happily, my right hand mirror finally showed up at the dealer (dropped the 
bike when I first got it, put on an EMGO replacement mirror... hated it the 
entire time that thing was on my bike because I couldn't see a DAMNED thing 
through it, plus it's flat instead of convex like the stock mirrors, so you 
get a NARROW ANGLE wobbly blur)... And I got a replacement windshield for my 
fairing (dropped the original and chipped the front edge... cosmetic but 
annoying)... so I spent half an hour happily unscrewing things and replacing 
them this afternoon.
 
 'Bout the only thing I still hate about the bike ('75 CB360T) is the damned 
""2 D-Cell Flashlight"" headlight.
 
 Has anyone seen a good source for ~25 watt halogen passing lights? Since 
the charging system on the CB360T can't handle continuous use of a 50W 
halogen headlight, I was thinking about putting a couple passing lights 
on... that would give me ~70w of lighting for the rare night riding I do, 
but wouldn't drain the battery during ""normal use"" (chiefly day trips and 
commuting to work and back)...

	HOW TO GET A VERBAL WARNING FOR 146 IN A 55

It's simple.  First, it has to be the first really nice riding day
of spring.  The bike is back together again, and so are you.  Grab
all your gear, put it on, and fill the tank with 94 octane premium
or better.  Head out.

	In Ames, there is a road that leads to the little town of
Gilbert.  Gilbert has one stop light, if that tells you something.
Having just gotten the bike back together, I thought I'd take it
for a short ride and check things out.  Heading out of town, I
went into the twisties at a slow pace, just under the speed limit,
and started leaning around.  The pace quickened as everything felt
just right.  Finally, the road straightened and I was ready for a
bit of speed.  Grab third gear, open her up.  At roughly 90mph
grab fourth gear.  Look at as much of the bike as you can, and fail
to notice a state trooper following a quarter mile behind.  Twist
the throttle like a fool, grab fifth gear at 130 or so, and see
just how well she's been put back together.

	At 146 (according to radar) I noticed the front fender was
flexing a bit.  Thus, I slowed, pulled off the road, removed my
helmet and gloves, unslung the took kit I was carrying in a fanny
pack, and was just starting to tighten that fender when the trooper
pulled in all hot and flustered.

	""Have you *ANY* idea how fast you were going?""
""Not precisely, no.  I was paying attention to the bike and road,
not the instruments.  I just got her back together last night, and
I'm just out here testing her out before I ride it in traffic.""
	""My radar says you were at over 145mph.  Care to tell me why
I shouldn't give you a ticket?""
""Because I was testing the motorcycle away from population and
traffic, on a strait and flat road, while wearing all the protective
gear that safety demands?"" (note: I wasn't quite that eloquent)
	""Say, what kind of bike is that, anyway?""
<I was eloquent on my cafe racer replica Honda 750, a Rat Bike>
	""Yeah, I haven't had my bike out of the garage in years.""
<compare riding stories>
<pack toolkit, having tightened that fender>
	""So why were you out here?""
""I figure every other idiot on the road is going to look right through
me.  If the bike fails somehow in a 35mph zone, I'm dead.  If it holds
up out here, then I know it will work right in traffic.  I do this
evvery year when I rebuild her.""
	""Not any more.  You'll find a better place than *my* highway
to do those speeds.  If I *ever* catch you speeding on my highway
again I'm going to nail you for everything I possibly can.  Now get
out of my sight before I write you a ticket.""
""Yes, officer.""
	""And kid, keep your eyes open out there..."" <drives off>

	And that, in a nut-shell, is how to get a warning for 146 in a 55.
I don't guarantee that it will work for you, but it worked for me.

1) If the Ninja has adjustable suspension, adjust it to a stiffer
setting so you don't bottom out in bumpy curves.

2) Tell her the 3 cardinal rules are:

a) NEVER EVER EVER EVER put her feet down. Not when you stop at a STOP
sign, not when she thinks you're gonna crash, never. Keep them on the
pegs until you tell her to get off the bike.

b) She is to hold onto your waist. She should hold on tightly enough
that she won't slide off the bike if you twist the throttle a bit. And
(added bonus for you here), she should keep as close to your butt as
possible so quick stops don't make her slide into you and knock your
balls up onto the gas tank. You decide how best to word this.

c) Just stay perpendicular to the bike; straight up in the seat. Don't
lean your body into curves, just go with the bike and stay perpendicular.
Don't look over your shoulder.*

3) Remember at all times that you have a passenger on the back. That
means don't pop the clutch, and try to corner and stop smoother than
usual. Be aware that if you jump on the brake, you're going to have
the equivalent of a 100 lb. dead weight crashing into you from behind,
so be prepared for that.

4) Make sure she pisses before the ride even if she says she doesn't
have to go. No anti-women stuff here; I have a tiny bladder myself.

5) Remind her to look around while you're riding. Point to things
of interest. It makes the ride more enjoyable to her (she won't get
so focused on just looking at the back of your helmet), and it gives
her ample excuse to squeeze you to show she saw what you pointed at.

* My wife and I tried the MSF-recommended ""look over the rider's
shoulder in curves"" bit, and it just didn't work. The timing of
her weight shift was unpredictable (especially on the Maxim because,
unlike the Ninja, the upright riding position really restricts the
pillion's view of the road ahead). Next time I had her just remain
perpendicular to the bike, and I could hardly tell there was someone
else on the bike in curves, and she weighs substantially over 100 lbs.

   Now, in keeping with the  grand tradition of wreck.moto, let's  mutate!
   Take your partners by the hand...

   On Tuesday morning I spent a couple of hours (when I -should- have been
   working) with a  torch, brazing bits  of scrap metal  over the  biggest
   holes in  Yamadog's exhaust  pipes (s'mazin'  what you  can do  with  a
   couple of AA  cells and a  three-volt bulb!).   I stuck some  ""gun-gum""
   into the smaller holes and bunged the pipes back onto the bike.

   So, last night  I'm on the  way home  when lo' an'  bloody behold,  the
   sodding thing starts  blowing again.   I check  it out and  the gas  is
   escaping from around  the clamp holding  the number two  pipe into  the
   port.  As far as I can see (it being somewhat ""hole of Calcutta"" at the
   time!), the nuts are still there  (stop that bloody sniggering, you  at
   the back!), but the pipe is a bit loose.

   This morning  I go  out to  the bike  and pull  out the  socket-set  to
   tighten up me' nuts (somebody give that  spotty kid at the back a  good
   slap  round  the  back  of  the  head!),  and  lo'  an'  bloody  behold
   a-bloody-gen, I find that the outer skin of the pipe has separated from
   the inner sleeve right at the clamp-mating bevel.  So, I stuff in a bit
   of baked-beanz can and a bit more of Mr Holts' very best ""gun-gum""  and
   come to work (late again!) so that I  can ask of the oracle...  Will  a
   brazed joint hold that close to the exhaust port?  Anybody tried it?

   Oh, and if anybody can tell me  what the differences are between a  205
   and a  207  brazing  rod (made  by  ""Gaz""  [Yup!   the  camping  folks.
   Surprised the marmalade outa' me, too!] in that place just off the Isle
   of Wight) I'd be eternally  grateful (twenty-sodding-quid for two  rods
   and I don't even know what I'm buying.  Bloody kanji!).

Maybe you had accidentally sealed in some water?  I cleaned my chain
thoroughly, took it on a short ride to dry it off and heat it up
a bit, and the paraffin sank deep into the rollers and formed a good
seal on the outside.  No rust, but then again I live in Tucson!

OK.  And you regularly ride your bike to within 2% of it's maximum capability?
(Note any idiot can go flat out on a bike - most of them do.)

Anyway, efficient at what?  A shaft drive is a much more efficient solid (erect) lump
of metal than a floppy (flaccid, unsatisfying) chain.

I know there's already a bmw mailing list, but since it's an R bike 
only list (and limited to the R80* R100* bikes as well I believe)
I've decided to give this a go and see how much interest there is.
please read all of this post if you plan on subscribing to the list!

there is only one restriction for the discussion on this list, that it
be about BMW's. I don't care which BMW, any and all are welcome. I will
probably post articles that appear in the local BMW club newsletter, and
would incourage other club members to do the same, especially tech
articles.

to subscribe to the list, send a message to the list address:

                    bmw@rider.cactus.org

with the word SUBSCRIBE (in caps) in the *subject* of the message. having
the word SUBSCRIBE in the *subject* is the _only_ way to subscribe. if you 
put the keyword in the message body, your message will go out to everyone
on the list and you will be ridiculed beyond belief.

       ** your From: line must have a valid return address    **
       ** the list sw will use the address in your From: line **

if you would like to use a return address _other_ than what is contained
in your From: line, do not send mail to the list! send a note directly to
me (joe@rider.cactus.org) and I'll take care of it manually.

the list sw will hack up the outgoing message From: line so that your
original full name in ()'s is preserved, but the return address is
replaced with the mailing list address (bmw@rider.cactus.org). this 
allows you to simply reply to a message to keep it on the list (depending
on your mail interface natch. I use elm so that's what I wrote it for :-).
keep this in mind when you reply to a message and question the authors
parentage.

to remove your name from the list, send a message to the list address
with the word UNSUBSCRIBE (in caps) in the *subject* of the message.
having the word UNSUBSCRIBE in the *subject* is the _only_ way to remove
your name from the list. if you put the keyword in the message body, 
your message will go out to everyone on the list and you will be ridiculed 
beyond belief.

the list is run from my home system, a poor little 286 box running a
very old version of something that smells somewhat like unix. the MTA
isn't the smartest around, but I've managed to hack it up enough to make
a decent list MTA. additions and removals are handled automatically by
scripts that intercept messages based on the subject (see below) and
may occassionally goof. the sw will send a response message back when you
subscribe. if you do not receive a response within a reasonable amount
of time (my link is via UUCP and sometimes runs in spurts), send me a 
message (joe@rider.cactus.org) and I'll look into it.

if the list turns out to be too popular and the MTA groks over the number
of addresses, I'll have to freeze the list recipients until I can come up
with a better MTA.

good luck...

Yup. Do it whenever I am in the cage (which is not often if its riding weather

sport bikes and arm out/up works best for Harleys. Similar to how I wave when

Me too, though unfortunately the ""Official Line"" is the one that you
have to adhere to if you want to get a full licence. The examiner's
guidelines are laid down by the government, and the basic rider education
courses have no choice but to follow them. It surprises me that none of the
rider groups here, either MAG or the BMF make much noise about the fact that
the riding test requires you to ride three feet from the kerb all the time
in order to pass, that the front brake must be applied before the rear, that
you have to keep looking over your shoulder all the time (instead of just
when it is justified) - there's probably a few more too, which I can't
think of for the moment. If the riding test could be rejigged a bit 
to include more of the real-world survival skills and less of the 
woefully simplistic crap that it contains now, then the accident figures
would (imho) reduce still further.

Don't think we should include countersteering knowledge in our test though...

Did they ever put in any gas stations on US 12?  I rode through there in
1987, skipped a fillup at Bryce Canyon and rode 100+ miles before seeing
a gas station at Torrey.  Awesome road, I recall riding up a narrow ridge

I bought a Yamaha XS850 with 8K miles.  Over the last 2 years, I've put 30K
of commute miles onnit.  Valve adjustment intervals are suppossed to be every
5K.  Well every 7.5K or so, I've checked the pad clearences, and they never
change!  If anything, the clearances seem to be getting a little smaller which
makes no sense to me with the pad system - the pads should wear until the
clearances are too great right?  I know that threaded adjusters can tighten 
up, but I didn't think these kind could.

Bottom lines is that I haven't touched my valves for 30K on this bike and
they are still nice and quiet and if anything, the clearances are tighter...
What's the deal?  Any other Yam triple owners notice extremely long valve
adjustment intervals?

So, hey, like, does this work the other way? If I was to like, you

the chain, could I increase the horsepower? 32 meters a sec is

I need help getting my ZX-11 (C3) to behave.  I've managed to get
the front suspension to be very happy, but the rear sucks.  I can't
do anything with it to make it feel ok.  The bike is very stable
through the corners (I think because I have the front just right),
but when the straights get bumpy the rear is torturous.  It feels
like it actually amplifies the bumps.  And the damping doesn't seem
to do anything in real-life, although you can tell the difference
when the bike isn't moving.  I've tried 4-5 cm of sag (from
completeley unloaded), but I don't know which way to go.  Has anyone
gotten the rear of this bike comfortable?  And if so, what kind of
settings (esp. what sag) did you use.  I like to corner, but I also
would like my kidneys to remain intact.  This thing makes the new
ZX-7 feel comfy....

     Quite right, your batteries should be perfectly alright and retain
most of their charge if drained and dried well, but I'd throw out the
electrolyte and buy some more when you need it.


     And before anyone says I'm wrong, remember that new batteries almost
always come ready charged and dry, and they are perfectly OK even after
several years' storage at the shop.

I just installed a MC Power Arc II, and it seems to run great. I also
used MC coils, and neither the ignition module or the coils required
any new mounting holes to be drilled on my 92 FXSTC. A little soldering
and all was fine. Static timing was real easy to set too. 

On the other side of the coin, my local wrench, whose opinion I
invariably seek but don't always adopt, thinks MC Power Arc is a ""piece
of shit"" and says ""all them Jap chips are gonna fail you one day"". 
Needless to say, he doesn't like any electronic ignition modules, and
recommends the Dyna-S system. I think that's the one with the
Hall-effect timing sensor(s), correct?

My best advice would be to contact a local dealer (see the yellow
pages under ""Motorcycle Dealers"") and ask for the address of the local
section BMW Owners Club.  The local BMW dealer will give you details
of the BMW Insurance terms and the club will help you with all
details.  Getting a bike from the dealer is the best bet, if you can
afford it.  The warranty is fairly handy as BM bits are made from
solid gold, apart from the parts made from ruby and platinum.  Apparently.

After failing my State of New Hampshire Noise Gestapo test with my HD
Slash cut pipes I installed my new Bubs (which I had been planning to
do anyway), went to a different in spection station, and passed with no
problem at about 97 dB.

Two points:

First, I don't think the first dude did the noise test correctly. 
Holding the meter close to his body probably caused a high reading, and
doing it inside the garage with the door closed undoubtedly enhanced
the dB level! So if any other NH riders need to get this done, make
sure the inspection is done outdoors with the meter held well away from
the body.

Second, these Bub pipes are bloody terrific. At low revs or cruising
through town, they as quiet as the stock pipes, but have a sound thats
a more throaty, purring, rumble.  When you open her up to >3000 RPM
they emit a wonderfully satisfying rumbling roar. Best of both worlds!

The first few times I pillioned someone whose safety was a great concern to

I was surprised to discover that it is much safer to just drive than to
distract yourself by trying to be unusually cautious and concerned.  Abruptly

When I needed heated grips I made them from pieces of an old bicycle

since at least one other person was interested in this:

my FZR's black exhaust pipes are rusty and i researched getting them repaired.
yesterday i bought a can of VHT 1500 degree black header paint and spent an
hour sanding two of the header pipes by hand.  sprayed on paint.  thought
about how clean i was able to get the metal with sanding and determined that
i wouldn't be at all suprised if the paint wore/chipped off in a month.

soooo call a couple of places up in minneapolis and discover that powder
coating, while extremely durable, will not handle over ~600 degree
temperatures.  the place i talked to said they were experimenting with
some new powder that is supposed to handle 1100 degrees but that it wouldn't
be available for months at least.  they directed me to another shop that
specializes in header coating.

the other shop said they have 2 coatings available.  one is aluminized that
can do 1200+ degrees and is ""comparable"" to powder coating for durability.
the other is silicon (i think) based and can do 1800+ degrees (!) but is
thinner and not as durable.  both coatings have a textured finish (not
super smooth) and should be cleaned with hot water and a brush.

price for 4 1-foot header pipes and a 2-foot 4-2-1 collector was ~$100.  i'm
planning to take the parts up friday and get them back (UPS) next week maybe
wednesday.

sounds to me like this kind of coating stuff should be way better than paint
considering how much abuse the pipes get from road crap/rocks.

	Spray the chain wax onto the rollers and sideplates occassionally, and
rust will not be a problem.

She's 80 lbs.

She let wind break cause I fed her cheap food, and not
the same thing every time.  So she had to ""adjust"" to

I guess I was semi-serious. Without using my hands, I lean and the bike 
turns. When leaning, a torque is applied, at a 90deg angle to the front 
wheel's axle, just as in countersteering. However, this torque is also about 
90deg from the axis of the steering head. Instead of making the 
bike lean, gyroscopic effect makes the bars turn, but I don't remember 
which way.

An even better strategy is to leave less of a buffer between you and
the car in front, but enough to manuver around it.  Keep the bike in
1st gear with the clutch handle squeezed in (how's that for
engaged/disengaged?), until there are two cars stopped behind you.

When the next BDI cager comes screaching in, simply ride up along side
of the car in front of you.  You don't need to panic and do it, or you
will pop the clutch and stall the engine.  Do is smoothly, just
rapidly.  The cage in front of you will provide MUCH better protection
than anything else (particularly empty road).

What worked for me on my RD350 was to lean towards the dog as I modulated
throttle to keep my ankle just ahead of his teeth.  After a few seconds of
warm pipe firmly wedged on his shoulder he turned his face sideways to see
what was so warm and got his mouth/nose/muzzle burned on the pipes.  One
yip and he veered away, never to chase me again.

My experience is when they pound their fists on your back it means ""slow down"".

Seriously, concentrate on being very smooth, and you will make her
experience much more enjoyable.  Even a normal upshift causes your
passenger to bob, so I ease off the throttle before pulling in the
clutch to eliminate this.  It's more work, but your passenger will
appreciate it!  Also, I've found that using more rear brake than normal
helps keep the bike from diving as much during routine stops, which
makes it much easier for the passenger to hang on.  If you're going
sport riding, have the passenger reach around you and brace themselves
against the tank so you don't have to bear both your weights with your
arms.  (Again your bike will dive less too)

Oh horse puckey.  Without their cop partner in attendance, they are less likely

O.k.  so you've disabled the dog's mouth, and given up use of your arm to do
so.  How `bout them front and read paws, and the fact that to plug up that

Have you ever tried to snap leg or crush the skull of a dog without use of

full cooperation of the beastie involved, it's not *that* easy.  Oh, but wait,
you've got your arm shoved in the dogs mouth.  You lose....

A few random thoughts on riding with a passenger:

There's no substitute for a bike with sufficient power, having taken
passengers very occasionally on the small (125 etc) bikes I used to
ride in the UK it was hard ! I'm now riding a GS1100 and that's great,
even moving from my freinds GSX600 I was riding recently. This may be due
in part to the fact that neither I, nor my regular passengers, are
particularly slimline !

I always tell passengers, stay in line with the bike on corners, that makes
their movements predictable.

My regular passengers both tend to hold either the rack or nothing at all,
I don't really like having a passenger hold onto me except for short periods.
Again that may be biased by the fact that I've had a couple of new passengers
(a friend recently for her first time on a bike) who hold on to me real tight,
making any kind of maneuvering difficult.

I've also discovered that on longer trips I prefer a passenger who moves and
shifts their weight a bit. I recently took a work collegue to a meeting (about
a 1 hour ride) and he sat totally still the whole way which left me also
sitting very still and getting a sore back.

We have a code system for turns, stop and for 'I need to shift position'.
